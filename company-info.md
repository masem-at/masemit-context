# masemIT Company Information

## Personal
My birthday is July 14, 1976, I have two children, Anna (2006) and Daniel (2008), and I live separately from Karin, the children's mother.

My hobbies: development of all kinds 😊, soccer (passive + coach in a small U23 club), skiing (as long as my joints allow it—I played too much soccer), sometimes I get overcome by a reading frenzy, Netflix, true crime. My nickname is Sempre, my real name is Mario Semper.

### TellingCube.com (Status: pre-launch MVP, happend on 12/17/2025)

tellingCube is a SaaS tool that generates realistic, mathematically consistent business data for testing, demos, and training. Using AI-powered event sourcing, it creates thousands of interconnected business events (sales, payroll, procurement) that perfectly reconcile across finance and sales views—eliminating the “fake data problem” where synthetic datasets contain impossible patterns. Available as CSV downloads and JSON API, it's built for BI developers, consultants, and trainers who need production-quality demo data in minutes instead of days.
