## Current Status

### Already Live on Product Hunt
- tellingCube is already listed (Coming Soon or soft-launched)
- **David Firouzbakht** upvoted 11 days ago (organic discovery!)
- This means: People are FINDING us without promotion

### New Assets Since Original Plan (Dec 2025)

| Asset | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Brian Julius Video** | 55K follower endorsement, "ivory-billed woodpecker" |
| **Brian Video Transcript** | Quotable testimonials for landing page |
| **Jürgen Faisst Contact** | IBCS Institute credibility (collaboration offer) |
| **3 Paying Customers** | Real revenue proof (€87) |
| **295 Visitors** | +1.5K% growth, 74 from LinkedIn |
| **Organic PH Upvote** | Product Hunt algorithm boost |

---

## Launch Strategy Options

### Option A: Soft Launch → Full Launch (RECOMMENDED)

**Why:** We're already getting organic traction. Build momentum before big push.

**Timeline:**

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Week 1 (Now)** | Optimize listing, add Brian quotes, respond to David's upvote |
| **Week 2** | Gather 5-10 more testimonials, implement "5 Curated Reports" |
| **Week 3** | Schedule full launch for Tuesday/Wednesday |
| **Launch Day** | Execute full Product Hunt campaign |

### Option B: Immediate Full Launch

**Why:** Strike while Brian's post is still warm (2 weeks old).

**Risk:** Less preparation, fewer testimonials lined up.

### Option C: Wait for HR + Multi-Year Features

**Why:** Launch with bigger feature set.

**Risk:** Momentum fades, Brian's endorsement gets older.

**Recommendation:** Option A - Soft Launch → Full Launch in 2-3 weeks.

## Updated Product Hunt Content

### New Social Proof to Add

**Brian Julius Quote (for listing):**
> *"Inexpensive, non-subscription programs that PERFECTLY solve a single problem are the ivory-billed woodpeckers of the data world. Rumored to be extinct, I spotted two in 2025 - Typora in August, and now TellingCube..."*
> — Brian Julius, 6x LinkedIn Top Voice, IBCS Certified

**Brian on Data Quality:**
> *"It just does one thing, but it does it perfectly."*

**Brian on Integration:**
> *"It integrates beautifully with Plotly Studio."*

### Updated First Comment (Draft)

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Mario here, founder of tellingCube.

**Quick backstory:** I'm a developer from Austria who got tired of building fake Excel data for demos. You know the pain—Revenue doesn't match Cash Flow, Finance and Sales never reconcile.

**What Brian Julius said** (55K LinkedIn followers, IBCS certified):
> "Inexpensive programs that PERFECTLY solve a single problem are the ivory-billed woodpeckers of the data world. Rumored to be extinct, I spotted TellingCube in 2025."

He compared us to a Zippo lighter: *"One distinctive click instantly, reliably meets the exact need."*

**What you get:**
- 9 company scenarios (Startup/MidCap/LargeCap × 3 sectors)
- 12 months of event-sourced, mathematically consistent data
- CSV + JSON export (works with any BI tool)
- IBCS©-inspired visualizations

**Two paths:**
1. **General use:** Test dashboards, train models, demo solutions → tellingcube.com
2. **IBCS practitioners:** Certification-to-implementation gap → tellingcube.com/ibcs

**Founding member pricing:** €29-€299 lifetime access. No subscriptions.

Questions? I'm here all day. And if you work with IBCS, I'd especially love your feedback—we're exploring collaboration with the IBCS Institute.

Let's make "Sample Dataset (2017)" a thing of the past. 🚀

— Mario

## Open Questions for Mario

1. **Launch timing:** 2 weeks (prep time) or ASAP (momentum)?
2. **Brian involvement:** Should we ask him to comment/share on launch day?
3. **Jürgen mention:** Include IBCS Institute contact in social proof?
4. **Discount:** How much for PHTC2026 code? (10%? 20%?)

*Prepared by: Maya (Marketing)*
*Ready for: Mario's Review*

**Meine Empfehlung:**

Option A - Soft Launch → Full Launch in 2-3 Wochen.

Wir haben Momentum (Brian, Sales, Traffic). Aber ein bisschen Vorbereitung (Brian alertieren, Quotes hinzufügen) macht den Unterschied zwischen "gut" und "Top 5".

Was denkst du, Mario? 🚀
