1. **Week 1-2:** Ship technical PoC, validate with brother (controller)
2. **Week 2:** **Jürgen Faisst strategy call** (IBCS Institute CEO) - validate trainer pain, request certified consultant intros
3. **Week 2-3:** User interviews (3-5 IBCS trainers/consultants)
4. **Week 4:** Soft launch to personal network + landing page test
5. **Week 5:** **IBCS community launch** (Jürgen posts to 15K members, if partnership secured)
6. **Week 5-8:** Direct outreach to high-engagement LinkedIn contributors (150-200 active posters identified)

#### Thursday-Friday: Reddit Launch (Value-First Approach)

**r/BusinessIntelligence (Thursday):**
Title: "I built an alternative to Tableau Superstore for BI demos (inspired by IBCS© standards)"

Post:
```
Like many of you, I'm tired of using Tableau Superstore for every demo. It's free, but everyone's seen it a thousand times.

I spent the last few months building tellingCube—an AI tool that generates fresh business scenarios (Bakery, Hotel, SaaS, etc.) in 30 seconds.

Key features:
- Multi-view consistency: Sales, Finance, HR data reconciles (unlike ChatGPT which hallucinates)
- Inspired by IBCS© international reporting standards
- Free tier: Unlimited generations with watermarked exports
- Paid tier: $29-$999 lifetime (founding member pricing)

Not trying to sell, genuinely want feedback from this community. What scenarios would you use?

[Link to free demo]
```

**Engagement:**
- Respond to every comment
- Provide value (answer BI questions even if not about tellingCube)
- Share insights about data generation challenges
- Don't be salesy—let users discover value

**r/consulting (Friday):**
Title: "Consultants: Stop wasting 6 hours building demo data"

Post:
```
How many hours have you spent building fake financial data for client demos?

For me, it was 4-6 hours per workshop. Building Excel tables, making sure P&L balanced, ensuring headcount tied to payroll costs...

I built tellingCube to fix this: AI-generated business scenarios in 30 seconds.

Example: "Generate 3-year bakery financials" → Sales, Finance, HR views that reconcile.

Inspired by IBCS© reporting standards (had a great conversation with [IBCS CEO Name] about this).

Fellow consultants: Is this valuable? Or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?

Free demo: [link]
```

**Goal:** 100+ upvotes combined, 20-30 landing page visits per post, 2-5 founding members

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk #1: Low Conversion Rate (Free → Paid <5%)

**Mitigation:**
- A/B test pricing tiers (is $99 too high? Test $49 tier)
- Improve onboarding (show value in first 60 seconds)
- Add "ROI calculator" on landing page (show time savings in dollars)
- Testimonials from early members (social proof)

**Contingency:** If conversion <5% by Week 6, pivot to freemium + monthly subscription earlier

---

### Risk #2: IBCS© Community Doesn't Respond

**Mitigation:**
- Broaden target audience immediately (general BI consultants, educators)
- Adjust messaging to de-emphasize IBCS© (focus on "multi-view consistency" instead)
- Reddit/ProductHunt become primary channels instead of LinkedIn

**Contingency:** If <20 members from IBCS© community by Week 6, shift to broader BI positioning

---

### Risk #3: ChatGPT Launches Competing Feature

**Probability:** LOW (6-12 months out if at all)

**Mitigation:**
- Speed: Launch in 2 weeks, build community fast (first-mover moat)
- Differentiation: Emphasize event-sourced architecture (not replicable by simple prompts)
- Switching costs: Lifetime pricing locks in founding members

**Contingency:** If ChatGPT adds feature, position as "General AI vs. specialized professional tool"

---

### Risk #4: Only 100-150 Members by Week 12 (Miss Goal)

**Mitigation:**
- Extend founding member pricing to 200 members (lower goal)
- Increase paid ad budget if CAC is favorable
- Launch affiliate program (10% commission to referrers)

**Contingency:** $15,000-$30,000 revenue still validates market; proceed to Alpha phase with smaller community

---

## Post-Week 12: Transition to Alpha Phase

### Week 13 Actions (Immediately After 300 Members)

**1. Sunset Lifetime Pricing**
- Landing page update: "Founding member pricing has ended. New pricing: $29/month"
- Email to waitlist: "Missed founding member pricing, but here's early bird monthly ($19/month for first 100)"
- Preserve founding member exclusivity (they feel special)

**2. Announce Alpha Roadmap**
- Based on founding member feedback (survey top 50 members)
- Publish transparent roadmap: "Next 4-8 weeks we're building X, Y, Z"
- Features: Custom prompts, 4th view, save scenarios, Excel export (if not done)

**3. IBCS© Certification Application**
- If partnership discussions progressing, submit scenarios for review
- Goal: Achieve certification by Month 6
- Marketing update: "IBCS© certification pending"

**4. Partnership Announcements**
- If university pilots successful, announce partnerships
- If Zebra BI or other tool partnerships secured, co-announce
- Press release: "tellingCube Partnerships with [X Universities/Tools]"

**5. Scale Marketing**
- If CAC <$50, increase paid ad budget to $2,000-$5,000/month
- Hire part-time content marketer (if revenue supports)
- Double down on SEO (10+ blog posts/month)
