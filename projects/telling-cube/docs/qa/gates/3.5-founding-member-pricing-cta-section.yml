gate_decision:
  status: "PASS"
  rationale: |
    Story 3.5 meets all 5 acceptance criteria with excellent code quality and proper integration
    with Story 3.4's Stripe checkout. The implementation follows all coding standards, includes
    proper error handling, and provides a responsive, user-friendly pricing section.

    The inherited rate limiting concern (SEC-001) is documented and appropriately deferred to
    Story 3.9 per architectural decision. This does not block Story 3.5 approval.

    Build and lint validations passed. No blocking issues identified.

  next_steps:
    - "✅ Story 3.5 approved - ready for integration"
    - "➡️ Ready to proceed to Story 3.6 (Confirmation Page)"
    - "⏭️ Story 3.9 must address SEC-001 before production deployment"

reviewer_notes: |
  Excellent implementation by James. All acceptance criteria met with high attention to detail.
  Tier details match PRD specifications exactly (FR9). Code quality is professional with proper
  error handling, loading states, and responsive design. The Stripe integration follows best
  practices by delegating to server-side API.

  The pricing section provides clear value communication with the benefits list above the cards,
  making the conversion funnel intuitive and trustworthy.

  Ready for user testing and production deployment (pending Story 3.9 rate limiting).
