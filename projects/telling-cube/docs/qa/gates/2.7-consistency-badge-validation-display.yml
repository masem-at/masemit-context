nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Input validation present (400 for missing scenarioId). Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection. React auto-escapes content (XSS prevention). Generic error messages prevent information disclosure. No security vulnerabilities identified.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent performance with parallel data fetching (metadata + validation). Lazy loading badge component. Minimal re-renders with proper React dependencies. Estimated validation API response: ~100-300ms.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation (validation failures don''t block page render). Three distinct states (loading, success, warning) with proper transitions. Type-safe implementation prevents runtime errors.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code quality with clean separation of concerns. JSDoc documentation present. Follows established patterns from Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.6. Proper TypeScript interfaces. No code duplication.'
