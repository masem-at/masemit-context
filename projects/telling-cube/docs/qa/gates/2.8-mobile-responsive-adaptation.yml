nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Purely presentational changes (CSS/layout). No new API calls, data handling, or authentication changes. React auto-escapes content preventing XSS.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent performance optimization. Conditional rendering prevents unnecessary re-renders. CSS-only transitions leverage GPU acceleration. No additional network requests. First Load JS unchanged at 102 kB. Web Vitals impact neutral to positive (improved FID via larger touch targets, improved CLS via sticky positioning).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust error handling inherited from existing views. Mobile layout works gracefully with loading/error states. Breakpoint logic deterministic (sm: 640px threshold). Graceful degradation if JavaScript fails (both views render without tab navigation).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exceptional code quality. Clear JSDoc comments explaining WHY. Type-safe TypeScript (TabType union). Tailwind utility classes self-documenting. No magic numbers. Easy to extend (adding third tab requires minimal changes). Zero technical debt identified.'
