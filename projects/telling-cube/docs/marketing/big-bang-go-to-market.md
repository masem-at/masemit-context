# tellingCube Big Bang Go-To-Market Strategy

**Version:** 2.0 (Big Bang Launch)
**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Author:** Maya Rivera (Marketing)
**Status:** READY FOR EXECUTION

---

## Executive Summary

tellingCube v2.0 "Big Bang" transforms from a demonstration tool into a full commercial product. This GTM document consolidates all marketing assets, strategies, and execution plans for a coordinated launch across Product Hunt, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and direct outreach.

**Key Launch Message:**
> "Realistic business data that actually reconciles."

**Launch Timing:** January 23-31, 2026

---

## 1. Strategic Positioning

### Core Message (CRITICAL - Memorize This)

tellingCube is **NOT an "IBCS tool for IBCS people."**

tellingCube is a **"Realistic Business Data Generator for anyone who needs consistent test data."**

### One-Liner
> "Realistic business data that actually reconciles."

### The Problem We Solve
> "Synthetic data is either random garbage or takes weeks to build. AI hallucinates numbers that don't reconcile. Real data has compliance issues. You need realistic test data now."

### The Solution
> "tellingCube generates event-based business data where every view—Finance, Sales, HR—derives from the same transaction stream. No reconciliation errors. No data prep. Consistent, export-ready scenarios in minutes."

### Key Differentiators

| tellingCube | Competition |
|-------------|-------------|
| Event-sourced architecture | Random number generation |
| Cross-departmental consistency | Siloed, unconnected data |
| Controller-validated | No validation |
| 2-3 minutes | Hours of manual work |
| No compliance risk | Real data = legal issues |

### IBCS Role
IBCS is now a **feature**, not the **product**:
- "Charts follow IBCS® visualization standards" (small print)
- Do NOT lead with IBCS in headlines or main selling points

---

## 2. Target Audiences (Priority Order)

| # | Audience | Pain Point | Message |
|---|----------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **BI Consultants** | Client demos with fake-looking data | "Stop using lorem ipsum for your dashboards" |
| 2 | **Software Vendors** | Product demos that look unrealistic | "Demo data that passes scrutiny" |
| 3 | **Trainers/Educators** | Recycled sample datasets | "Fresh scenarios for every workshop" |
| 4 | **Developers/QA** | Test data without production risks | "Realistic test data, zero compliance risk" |
| 5 | **Data Scientists** | Need statistically valid synthetic data | "Event-sourced, mathematically consistent" |

**Primary Post (Variant A - Founder Story):**
```
8 weeks ago, I had a problem.

I needed realistic business data for testing and demos. ChatGPT gave me nonsense. Excel mockups took hours.

So I built tellingCube.

What it does:
Generate thousands of realistic business events in minutes.
Sales transactions, payroll, procurement - all mathematically consistent.

Export your data:
- CSV download for Excel/Python/R
- JSON API for integration
- Raw events for ML training
- Aggregated views for demos

NEW in v2.0:
- User dashboard with scenario history
- Background generation (email when ready)
- HR Domain with workforce analytics
- Multi-year data (up to 5 years)
- 3% of every purchase goes to children's hospice

Founding Member Lifetime Access:
Starting at €9 (single) to €299 (full access).

Perfect for:
- BI developers testing dashboards
- Data scientists training models
- Consultants demoing solutions
- Professors teaching financial analysis

Built in Austria | tellingcube.com

What problems do YOU solve with synthetic data?

#BusinessData #SyntheticData #DataGeneration #SaaS
```

**Self-Reply (Post 2-4 Hours Later):**
```
Quick update: A few people asked how the "mathematical consistency" actually works.

Here's the simple version: Instead of generating random numbers, tellingCube generates business EVENTS first (a sale, a payment, a hire). Then every view - Finance, Sales, HR - is calculated FROM those same events.

So when Finance shows €50K payroll cost, you can trace it back to exactly which employees and hours generated that cost. No more "where did this number come from?"

If you work with business data and want to see it in action → tellingcube.com (takes about 2 minutes to generate your first scenario)

### 5.3 Twitter/X Strategy

**Launch Thread (7 tweets):**

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
I spent 3 hours building fake business data for a demo last month.

My client looked at it and said: "These numbers don't add up."

So I built something to fix this. Here's tellingCube:
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
The problem with AI-generated business data:

- ChatGPT: Revenue jumps 500% for no reason
- Excel mockups: Take forever, still look fake
- Seed databases: Outdated, don't fit your scenario

Clients spot fake data instantly. It kills your credibility.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
tellingCube generates thousands of consistent business events in minutes.

Not random numbers. A coherent company simulation:
→ Employees with real roles
→ Customers with purchase history
→ Products with seasonal patterns
→ Costs that match revenue

All mathematically consistent.
```

**Tweet 4 (How it works):**
```
How it works:

1. Pick a company profile (9 options: size x sector)
2. AI builds a complete "company world"
3. Code derives thousands of events from that world
4. Validation ensures everything adds up

~2 minutes. Done.
```

**Tweet 5 (What you get):**
```
What you actually get:

CSV download (thousands of events)
JSON API for integration
Sales breakdown by region, customer, product
Full P&L and cost analysis
NEW: HR Domain with workforce analytics

The data is the product. Charts just prove it works.
```

**Tweet 6 (Social proof):**
```
Brian Julius (55K followers, IBCS certified) called it:

"The ivory-billed woodpecker of the data world. One distinctive click instantly, reliably meets the exact need."

This isn't mock data. It's data that passes controller scrutiny.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
```

### 5.5 Direct Outreach (DM Templates)

**Template A - IBCS Certified Trainer/Consultant:**
```
Hi {Name},

I noticed you're IBCS certified - quick question if you have 30 seconds:

When you run workshops or client demos, how do you usually handle the demo data? Do you build it yourself or use standard datasets?

I'm asking because I just launched a tool that generates realistic, multi-view business datasets in minutes (Finance + Sales + HR views from the same events).

Not pitching - genuinely curious if this is a pain point you experience.

Mario
tellingcube.com
```

**Template B - BI Professional:**
```
Hi {Name},

Saw your post about {specific topic} - interesting perspective.

Quick question: When you need realistic test data for dashboards or demos, what's your go-to approach? Excel mockups? Sample datasets?

I built something that generates thousands of consistent business events (CSV/JSON export) - curious if that's something BI folks would actually use.

Happy to share access if you'd want to test it.

Mario
```

**Template C - Finance Professional:**
```
Hi {Name},

Random question from a fellow controller background:

Ever had to create realistic financial data for testing or training? The kind where Revenue, Costs, and Cash Flow all need to reconcile?

I built a tool that does this automatically - generates event-level data that's mathematically consistent across views. A controller friend validated it and said the numbers "actually make sense."

If you ever need test data: tellingcube.com

Mario
