# Post-Launch Outreach Drafts

**Created:** 2025-12-17 (Launch Day +3h)
**Author:** Maya Rivera (Marketing)
**Status:** Ready for use

---

## 1. LinkedIn Self-Reply Comment

*Purpose: Boost engagement algorithm, add value, explain differentiation*
*Timing: Post 2-4 hours after original post*

```
Quick update: A few people asked how the "mathematical consistency" actually works.

Here's the simple version: Instead of generating random numbers, tellingCube generates business EVENTS first (a sale, a payment, a hire). Then every view - Finance, Sales, HR - is calculated FROM those same events.

So when Finance shows €50K payroll cost, you can trace it back to exactly which employees and hours generated that cost. No more "where did this number come from?"

If you work with business data and want to see it in action → tellingcube.com (takes about 2 minutes to generate your first scenario)

## 2. Direct Message Templates

### Template A - IBCS Certified Trainer/Consultant

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're IBCS certified - quick question if you have 30 seconds:

When you run workshops or client demos, how do you usually handle the demo data? Do you build it yourself or use standard datasets?

I'm asking because I just launched a tool that generates realistic, multi-view business datasets in minutes (Finance + Sales views from the same events).

Not pitching - genuinely curious if this is a pain point you experience, or if trainers have better solutions I don't know about.

Mario
```

### Template B - Business Reporting/BI Professional

```
Hi [Name],

Saw your post about [specific topic they posted about] - interesting perspective.

Quick question: When you need realistic test data for dashboards or demos, what's your go-to approach? Excel mockups? Sample datasets?

I built something that generates thousands of consistent business events (CSV/JSON export) - curious if that's something BI folks would actually use.

Happy to share access if you'd want to test it.

Mario
```

### Template C - Finance/Controlling Professional

```
Hi [Name],

Random question from a fellow controller background:

Ever had to create realistic financial data for testing or training? The kind where Revenue, Costs, and Cash Flow all need to reconcile?

I built a tool that does this automatically - generates event-level data that's mathematically consistent across views. A controller friend validated it and said the numbers "actually make sense" (high bar from a controller).

If you ever need test data, happy to share: tellingcube.com

Mario

## 3. DM Personalization Tips

**Before sending ANY DM:**
1. Check their recent posts - mention something specific
2. Check their headline - tailor the pain point
3. Check if they're IBCS certified (often in headline or about section)
4. Check their company - B2B consulting? Corporate? Training?

**First line examples:**
- "Saw your post about [X] - really resonated with me..."
- "Your work on [project/company] caught my attention..."
- "Fellow [Austrian/controller/consultant] here..."

**What NOT to do:**
- Generic copy-paste with no personalization
- Immediate pitch without question
- Long paragraphs (keep it scannable)
- Multiple follow-ups in 24h

## 4. IBCS Institute Contact Email

**To:** contact@ibcs.com (or use website contact form)
**Subject:** Partnership inquiry: Demo data tool for IBCS trainers

```
Dear IBCS Institute Team,

My name is Mario, and I'm an Austrian developer who recently launched tellingCube - a tool that generates realistic, mathematically consistent business datasets for training and demo purposes.

Why I'm reaching out to IBCS specifically:

I built tellingCube because I experienced the pain of creating demo data that "looks real" for business reporting scenarios. The tool generates thousands of business events (sales, payroll, procurement) where all departmental views - Finance, Sales, HR - derive from the same underlying data.

The result: Numbers that always reconcile across views, which I understand is core to the IBCS philosophy of clear and consistent reporting.

Potential value for IBCS trainers:
- Generate fresh, realistic datasets for each workshop (no more recycling the same "bakery from 1995" example)
- Demonstrate cross-departmental consistency in minutes
- Export as CSV for Excel or JSON for BI tools
- IBCS-inspired chart previews included

I would love to explore whether tellingCube could be valuable for the IBCS certified trainer community. Specifically:

1. Would you be open to sharing this with a few trainers for feedback?
2. Is there someone who manages trainer resources I could speak with?
3. Would a partnership or official listing be of interest?

I'm happy to provide complimentary access for evaluation purposes.

Thank you for your time. I genuinely admire what IBCS has built for the reporting community and would be honored to contribute.

Best regards,

Mario

## 5. Follow-up Email (Send after 5-7 days if no response)

**Subject:** Re: Partnership inquiry: Demo data tool for IBCS trainers

```
Dear IBCS Team,

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about tellingCube - a tool for generating realistic business datasets.

I understand you receive many inquiries, so I'll keep this brief:

Since my last email, I've had positive feedback from finance controllers who validated the data quality. The tool is live and generating consistent multi-view datasets.

If there's a better contact for trainer resources or partnerships, I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Mario

## 6. LinkedIn Connection Request Notes (300 char max)

*Use these BEFORE sending DMs - connect first, then message*

### Template A - IBCS Certified (Generic)
```
Hi [Name] - saw you're IBCS certified. I just launched a tool for generating realistic demo data for workshops. Would love to connect and hear how you handle demo datasets. No pitch, genuinely curious. - Mario
```
(~250 chars)

### Template B - Referenced Their Post
```
Hi [Name] - loved your post about [topic]. Working on something related: a tool that generates consistent business data for reporting demos. Would value your perspective as an IBCS expert. - Mario
```
(~220 chars)

### Template C - Same Region/Background
```
Hi [Name] - fellow Austrian here, saw your work in business reporting. Just launched tellingCube for generating demo datasets. Always good to connect with others in the IBCS space. - Mario
```
(~210 chars)

### Template D - Consultant/Trainer Focus
```
Hi [Name] - noticed you run reporting workshops. Quick question: how do you handle demo data? Built a tool that might help. Would love to connect and hear your approach. - Mario
```
(~200 chars)

**Key principles:**
- Always personalize first line
- Ask a question or show curiosity (not "check out my product")
- Keep it under 250 chars (shorter = higher accept rate)
- Sign with your name (human touch)

### Optional P.S. for DMs (after they accept connection)

*Add this to your full DM message - sparks curiosity and shows you're a builder*

```
P.S. Built this using the BMAD method (multi-agent AI development) - happy to share how it works if you're curious about AI-assisted product building.
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you're technical and innovative (credibility)
- "Happy to share" = value-first mindset
- Creates second conversation thread (not just about tellingCube)
- Appeals to consultants who are always looking for new methods

## 7. LinkedIn Search Strategy (Sales Navigator)

**Sales Navigator filters to use:**
1. **Keywords:** `IBCS` or `"IBCS certified"` or `business reporting`
2. **Title:** Trainer, Consultant, Controller, BI Developer
3. **Geography:** DACH region first (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
4. **Posted on LinkedIn:** Last 30 days (CRITICAL - shows active users)
5. **Industry:** Management Consulting, IT Services, Financial Services

**Basic LinkedIn search queries (if no Sales Nav):**
- `"IBCS certified"` (in quotes)
- `"IBCS consultant"`
- `"business reporting" trainer`
- `"financial reporting" workshop`
- `IBCS` + filter by "Posts" (find engaged commenters)

**Profile signals to look for:**
- "IBCS" in headline or certifications
- "Trainer" or "Consultant" in title
- Posts about reporting, dashboards, data visualization
- Works at consulting firm or training company
- Posted recently (active = responsive)

**Why "Posted on LinkedIn" filter matters:**
- 80% of LinkedIn users are passive (rarely check)
- Recent posters are 5-10x more likely to respond
- You can reference their post = instant personalization

**Outreach workflow:**
1. Use Sales Nav to find 20 prospects with "Posted in last 30 days"
2. Check their recent post - note the topic
3. Send connection request with Template B (reference their post)
4. Once accepted (24-72h), send full DM from templates
5. Follow up after 48-72h if no response

Hi Gustaw,

Thanks for connecting! Quick question from one builder to another:

When you create your Power BI templates and tutorials for Data Vis Forge - how do you handle the demo data? Do you build it manually or have a go-to source?

I ask because I just launched tellingCube - generates realistic business events (sales, payroll, procurement) where Finance, Sales, and HR views are mathematically consistent. CSV/JSON export for Power BI.

Might be useful for your template packs or community tutorials. Happy to share access if you'd want to test it: tellingcube.com

P.S. Built this using the BMAD method (multi-agent AI development) - happy to share how it works if you're curious about AI-assisted product building.
