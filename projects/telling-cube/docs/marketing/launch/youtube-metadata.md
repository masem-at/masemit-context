## Subtitles/Captions

**Why subtitles matter:**
- 85% of social video is watched without sound
- Improves accessibility (deaf/hard of hearing)
- YouTube indexes subtitle text for SEO
- Non-native English speakers can follow along

**Two approaches:**

### Option A: Hardcoded (Burned into video) - RECOMMENDED for social
Best for: LinkedIn, Twitter (where you can't upload separate subtitle files)
- Subtitles are part of the video itself
- Works everywhere, no platform dependency
- Use for all social exports

### Option B: SRT Upload (YouTube only)
Best for: YouTube (allows viewers to toggle on/off)
- Upload separate .srt file in YouTube Studio
- Go to: YouTube Studio → Content → Select video → Subtitles → Add language → Upload file
- Choose "With timing" if your SRT has timestamps

**How to create subtitles:**

| Tool | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **CapCut** (Free) | Auto-transcribe + hardcode | Best free option, good accuracy |
| **Descript** (Freemium) | Auto-transcribe + export SRT | Very accurate, easy to edit |
| **YouTube Auto** | Auto-generate | Free but less accurate, review required |
| **Premiere/DaVinci** | Manual or auto | Pro tools, more control |

**Subtitle style (if hardcoding):**

**IMPORTANT:** tellingCube UI switches between black and white backgrounds. Static white or black text won't work everywhere.

**Recommended: Background box style**
- Font: Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica), bold
- Text color: White
- Background: Semi-transparent black box (60-80% opacity)
- Position: Bottom center, not too low (avoid mobile UI overlap)
- Size: Readable on mobile (test at 50% zoom)

This "pill" or "box" style works on ANY background - black, white, or colored.

**In CapCut:** Select subtitle → Style → Background → Choose dark color → Adjust opacity
**In Descript:** Styles → Pick a template with background box
**In Premiere:** Essential Graphics → Add rectangle behind text, reduce opacity

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Generate auto-transcription
- [ ] Review and fix errors (especially "tellingCube" spelling)
- [ ] Export hardcoded version for LinkedIn/Twitter
- [ ] Export SRT for YouTube (optional, YouTube auto-generates too)
- [ ] Test on mobile - are subtitles readable?

## SEO Notes

**Primary keywords to rank for:**
- "synthetic business data"
- "demo data generator"
- "realistic test data"
- "business intelligence sample data"

**Why this matters:** These are low-competition, high-intent searches. People searching these terms are actively looking for a solution. The video title + description + tags are all optimized for these terms.
