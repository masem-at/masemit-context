## Shot List & Script

### [00:00-00:10] Hook
**Screen:** tellingcube.com landing page (homepage visible with 9 scenario tiles)
**Action:** Cursor hovers over the scenario matrix (Size × Sector grid)

**Voiceover:**
*"Need realistic business data for testing or demos? Watch this. I'll generate thousands of consistent business events in minutes."*

**Tone:** Confident, direct, value-driven

---

### [00:10-00:20] Problem Setup
**Screen:** Show ChatGPT generating bad data (screenshot prepared) OR Excel mockup
**Action:** Briefly show example of "bad data" (revenue spike, inconsistent numbers)

**Voiceover:**
*"Most AI tools give you nonsense. Revenue that jumps 500%, costs that don't match reality. Clients spot it immediately."*

**Tone:** Empathetic frustration (you've been there too)

---

### [00:20-01:00] Solution & Live Demo (COMBINED)
**Screen:** Back to tellingCube homepage → Click scenario → Loading screen
**Action:**
1. Hover over 3×3 matrix while explaining (5-7 seconds)
2. Click "Mid Cap / Industrials" tile
3. Show loading status messages (speed up 4-6x)
4. Show stages: "Building company world..." → "Charting monthly business course..." → "Deriving financial events..."

**Voiceover:**
*"tellingCube is different. Built on event-sourcing architecture. Nine company profiles - three sizes, three sectors. I'll pick Mid Cap Industrials."*

[CLICK - generation starts]

*"Watch what happens. First, AI builds a complete company world - employees, customers, products. Then it charts the monthly business course. Code derives thousands of events. And finally, a consistency validation ensures everything adds up. All in a few minutes."*

**Tone:** Calm confidence, educational, seamless flow

**Editing Note:** Generation takes ~2-3 minutes (Mid Cap ~160s). Speed up 4-6x to fit in ~40 seconds of video. Show the progress stages clearly.

Scroll through Sales - regional breakdown, customer matrix, product performance. Switch to Finance - full P&L statement, cost breakdown by department. All from the same event stream.

## Backup Plan (If Generation Fails During Recording)

**Option 1:** Pre-record generation, then do voiceover
**Option 2:** Have 2 browser tabs ready (switch if one fails)
**Option 3:** Use existing generated scenario, narrate as if live

**Don't:** Show errors on camera (kills credibility)

---

## Recording Tools

**Recommended:** Loom (free, easy LinkedIn share)
**Alternative:** OBS Studio (more control, free)
**Screen size:** 1920x1080 (standard HD)

---

## Timeline

- [ ] Record after validation test completes (wait for GO verdict)
- [ ] Recording: 15-30 minutes (includes retakes)
- [ ] Editing: 30-45 minutes (trim, speed up, export)
- [ ] Upload same day as launch announcement

**Total time investment:** 1 hour

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

**NEVER mention**:
- ❌ Specific job titles from day work
- ❌ Family member names or "my brother"
- ❌ "60 seconds" (use "minutes" instead)

**ALWAYS verify**:
- ✅ Pricing is correct (€29-€999 ONE-TIME, not monthly!)
- ✅ Use "controller-validated" not personal identifiers
- ✅ Time claims are general ("minutes" not specific)

---

**Next Steps:** Wait for validation test → Record video → Launch! 🚀
