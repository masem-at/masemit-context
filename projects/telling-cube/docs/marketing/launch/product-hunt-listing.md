## Full Description

### The Problem

Need realistic business data for testing dashboards, training ML models, or demoing solutions? You have three bad options:

1. **AI generators** produce nonsense (revenue jumps 500% randomly)
2. **Manual Excel mockups** take hours and still look fake
3. **Real client data** creates privacy and legal nightmares

### The Solution

tellingCube generates 1 year of mathematically consistent business data in 2-3 minutes. Not random numbers—realistic transactions that pass controller scrutiny.

**How it works:**
1. Choose your scenario (9 company profiles: Startup/MidCap/LargeCap × 3 sectors)
2. AI generates thousands of event-sourced transactions (sales, payroll, procurement, HR)
3. Download your data or integrate via JSON API

### Why It's Different

**Event-Sourced Architecture = Zero Inconsistencies**
- Sales revenue matches P&L revenue. Always.
- Headcount matches payroll records. Always.
- Everything traces back to atomic business events.

**Controller-Validated**
Finance professionals with 10+ years experience verified the data models and calculations.

**Data-First, Charts Second**
The data is the product. We include IBCS©-inspired visualizations to prove the data quality, but the real value is in the raw transactions you export.

### What You Get

📥 **Export Options:**
- Raw events CSV (thousands of transactions)
