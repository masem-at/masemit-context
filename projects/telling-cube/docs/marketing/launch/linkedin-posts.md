## Variant A: Founder Story (Authentic) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Best for**: First post, authentic founder voice, builds trust

```
8 weeks ago, I had a problem.

I needed realistic business data for testing and demos. ChatGPT gave me nonsense. Excel mockups took hours.

So I built tellingCube.

🎯 What it does:
Generate thousands of realistic business events in minutes.
Sales transactions, payroll, procurement - all mathematically consistent.

📥 Export your data:
- CSV download for Excel/Python/R
- JSON API for integration
- Raw events for ML training
- Aggregated views for demos

Charts? We show IBCS©-inspired previews to demonstrate the data quality.
But the real value is the DATA itself.

✅ Validation: Tested by finance controllers with 10+ years experience
Result: [WAITING FOR VALIDATION - UPDATE THIS]

## Variant C: Problem-Agitate-Solve (Engagement)

**Best for**: Viral potential, relatable pain point, high comments

```
Ever spent 3 hours creating fake business data for a demo?

Only to have your client say: "These numbers don't add up" 😅

I did. Last month. That's why I built tellingCube.

💡 The insight:
Most "realistic" data generators produce GARBAGE.
- ChatGPT: Revenue jumps 500% randomly
- Excel: Takes hours, still looks fake
- Seed data: Outdated, doesn't fit YOUR scenario

🎯 What tellingCube does differently:
→ Event-sourced architecture (single source of truth)
→ Generates THOUSANDS of consistent business events
→ Cross-validated by finance controllers

📥 What you get in minutes:
- Raw events CSV (sales, payroll, procurement)
- JSON API for direct integration
- Aggregated Finance + Sales views
- IBCS©-inspired chart previews

The data is the product. Charts just show it works.

🎁 Founding member pricing: Lifetime access from €29 (pay once, use forever)
