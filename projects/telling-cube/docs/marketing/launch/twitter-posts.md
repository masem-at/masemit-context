## Platform Notes

**Twitter/X is different from LinkedIn:**
- Single tweets: 280 characters max
- Threads: 5-8 tweets optimal (more = drop-off)
- Tone: More casual, direct, punchy
- Hashtags: 1-2 max (or none - they're less important now)
- Video: Upload natively (don't just paste YouTube link)
- Best times: 8-10 AM or 5-7 PM (your audience's timezone)

## Variant A: Launch Thread (Storytelling) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Best for**: Launch day, founder story, builds following

**Thread (7 tweets):**

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
I spent 3 hours building fake business data for a demo last month.

My client looked at it and said: "These numbers don't add up."

So I built something to fix this. Here's tellingCube:
```

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
The problem with AI-generated business data:

- ChatGPT: Revenue jumps 500% for no reason
- Excel mockups: Take forever, still look fake
- Seed databases: Outdated, don't fit your scenario

Clients spot fake data instantly. It kills your credibility.
```

---

**Tweet 3 (Solution intro):**
```
tellingCube generates thousands of consistent business events in minutes.

Not random numbers. A coherent company simulation:
→ Employees with real roles
→ Customers with purchase history
→ Products with seasonal patterns
→ Costs that match revenue

All mathematically consistent.
```

---

**Tweet 4 (How it works):**
```
How it works:

1. Pick a company profile (9 options: size × sector)
2. AI builds a complete "company world"
3. Code derives thousands of events from that world
4. Validation ensures everything adds up

~2 minutes. Done.
```

---

**Tweet 5 (What you get):**
```
What you actually get:

📥 CSV download (thousands of events)
📥 JSON API for integration
📊 Sales breakdown by region, customer, product
📊 Full P&L and cost analysis
📊 Notable events marked on trends

The data is the product. Charts just prove it works.
```

---

**Tweet 6 (Social proof):**
```
Tested by finance controllers with 10+ years experience.

Their verdict: [UPDATE WITH VALIDATION RESULT]

This isn't mock data. It's data that passes scrutiny.
```

---

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**

```

---

**Engagement tip:** After posting the thread, reply to your own Tweet 7 with the demo video (native upload, not YouTube link).

---

## Variant B: Single Tweet + Video (Quick Launch)

**Best for**: If you want one punchy tweet with video attached

```
I got tired of AI giving me fake business data that clients spot instantly.

So I built tellingCube:
→ Thousands of consistent business events
→ Sales, payroll, procurement - all connected
→ Ready in 2 minutes

Lifetime access from €29.

tellingcube.com
```

**Attach:** Demo video (native upload)

**Character count:** 274

---

## Variant C: Problem-First Thread (High Engagement)

**Best for**: Viral potential, relatable pain, more retweets

**Thread (5 tweets):**

---

**Tweet 1:**
```
"These numbers don't make sense."

Every consultant's nightmare.

You spend hours on demo data. Client spots it's fake in 30 seconds.

Here's why - and how I fixed it:
```

---

**Tweet 2:**
```
Most "realistic" data fails because it's not connected.

Revenue doesn't match costs.
Sales don't match P&L.
Growth patterns are random.

Your brain spots inconsistency instantly. So does your client's.
```

---

**Tweet 3:**
```
The fix: Event-sourcing.

Instead of generating numbers, generate EVENTS.
→ Sales transactions
→ Payroll runs
→ Procurement orders

Then derive the numbers from those events.

Single source of truth = mathematical consistency.
```

---

**Tweet 4:**
```
I built this into tellingCube.

Pick a company profile. Wait 2 minutes. Get:
- Thousands of consistent events (CSV)
- Full company simulation (employees, customers, products)
- P&L that actually adds up

Controller-validated. Ready to use.
```

---

**Tweet 5:**
```
Launching today with founding member pricing:

Lifetime access from €29. Pay once, use forever.

tellingcube.com

Who else has been burned by fake demo data?
```

---

## Variant D: Teaser (Pre-Launch or Hype)

**Best for**: Build anticipation if posting before official launch

```
Launching something tomorrow.

8 weeks of building. Thousands of lines of code.

One problem solved: Realistic business data that doesn't look fake.

More soon.
```

**Character count:** 178

## Video Upload Instructions

**For native Twitter video (recommended over YouTube link):**

1. Export video at 1080p (1920x1080)
2. Format: MP4, H.264 codec
3. Max length: 2:20 (your video is ~1:50, perfect)
4. Max file size: 512MB
5. Upload directly to Twitter (don't paste YouTube link)

**Why native matters:** Twitter suppresses external links. Native video gets 10x more reach.

---

## Hashtag Strategy

**Less is more on Twitter. Pick 0-2:**

- #buildinpublic (if you want indie hacker audience)
- #saas (broad B2B)
- None (often performs better - feels less promotional)

**Don't use:** Long hashtag chains like LinkedIn. Looks spammy on Twitter.

---

## Reply Strategy (First 2 Hours)

Twitter rewards fast engagement. Plan these replies:

**Self-reply to thread (immediately after posting):**
```
If you're a BI developer, data scientist, or consultant who's tired of fake demo data - I built this for you.

Happy to answer any questions in the replies.
```

**If someone asks "how is this different from [X]":**
```
Most generators produce random numbers. tellingCube generates events first, then derives numbers from those events.

Single source of truth = everything adds up mathematically.

That's why controllers validated it passes scrutiny.
```

**If someone asks about pricing:**
```
Founding member pricing:

€29 - Individual
€99-€299 - Professional tiers
€599 - Small team (5 seats)
€999 - Department (20 seats)

All one-time. Lifetime access. No subscriptions ever.
```

---

## Timing Strategy

**Best posting times for B2B/tech Twitter:**
- Weekdays: 8-10 AM or 5-7 PM (audience timezone)
- Tuesday-Thursday typically best
- Avoid weekends for B2B

**Launch day sequence:**
1. **Morning (8-9 AM):** Post main thread
2. **+30 min:** Reply with video
3. **+2 hours:** Engage with all replies
4. **Afternoon:** Share to LinkedIn (different content)
5. **Evening:** Quote-tweet your own thread with a single insight

---

## Cross-Posting Note

**Don't copy-paste between LinkedIn and Twitter.**

- LinkedIn: Longer, more professional, emojis OK
- Twitter: Shorter, punchier, less formal

The thread format here is Twitter-native. Your LinkedIn posts are LinkedIn-native. Keep them separate.
