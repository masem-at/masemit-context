## Tweet 1 (Hook)

```
"These numbers don't make sense."

Every consultant's nightmare.

You spend hours on demo data. Client spots it's fake in 30 seconds.

Here's why - and how I fixed it:
```

## Tweet 2

```
Most "realistic" data fails because it's not connected.

Revenue doesn't match costs.
Sales don't match P&L.
Growth patterns are random.

Your brain spots inconsistency instantly. So does your client's.
```

## Tweet 3

```
The fix: Event-sourcing.

Instead of generating numbers, generate EVENTS.
→ Sales transactions
→ Payroll runs
→ Procurement orders

Then derive the numbers from those events.

Single source of truth = mathematical consistency.
```

## Tweet 4

```
I built this into tellingCube.

Pick a company profile. Wait 2 minutes. Get:
- Thousands of consistent events (CSV)
- Full company simulation (employees, customers, products)
- P&L that actually adds up

Controller-validated. Ready to use.
