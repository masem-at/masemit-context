## 1. Product Hunt First Comment

**Timing:** Post this 2-5 minutes after going live (looks organic, not pre-scheduled)

**Purpose:** Adds context, highlights IBCS positioning, drives engagement algorithm

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Mario here, founder of tellingCube.

**The backstory:** I'm a former controller who got tired of building Excel mockups for demos and training. You know the drill—you spend hours creating "realistic" business data, then Revenue doesn't match Cash Flow, and Finance numbers don't reconcile with Sales. Classic.

**What tellingCube does differently:**

Instead of generating random numbers, we generate **business events first** (a sale, a payment, a hire). Then every view—Finance, Sales, HR—is calculated FROM those same events.

Result: Numbers that actually make sense. Sales revenue = P&L revenue. Always.

**Two ways to use it:**

1. **Broad use case:** Need realistic test data for BI tools, demos, or training? Generate 12 months of consistent business data in under 3 minutes. Export as CSV/JSON.

2. **IBCS practitioners:** If you're IBCS© certified and tired of the certification-to-implementation gap, we built a dedicated flow for you: [tellingcube.com/ibcs](https://tellingcube.com/ibcs)

**What you get:**
✅ 5 business scenarios (SaaS startup, hotel, bakery, etc.)
✅ Event-sourced data (mathematically consistent across departments)
✅ Controller-validated models (10+ years finance experience)
✅ IBCS-inspired visualizations (grayscale, professional)
✅ CSV + JSON export (works with Excel, Power BI, Tableau, etc.)

**Special offer for Product Hunt:** Use code **PHTC2025** at checkout for early supporter pricing.

Questions? Ask away—I'm here all day. And if you work with business data and want consistent test datasets, I'd love your feedback.

Let's build something better than "Sample Dataset (2017)" together. 🚀

## 2. LinkedIn Launch Post

**Timing:** Post 2-4 hours AFTER Product Hunt goes live (drive traffic to PH from LinkedIn)

**Purpose:** Professional positioning, drive IBCS practitioner traffic

```markdown
🚀 After 6 months of nights and weekends, I just launched tellingCube on Product Hunt.

It's a tool that generates realistic, mathematically consistent business data in under 3 minutes.

**The problem I was solving:**

As a former controller, I spent countless hours building Excel mockups for demos and training. The pain wasn't just the time—it was that the numbers never reconciled across departments.

Revenue in the Sales report didn't match Revenue in Finance. Cash Flow didn't tie to P&L. It looked "realistic" but felt fake.

**Why this exists:**

tellingCube generates business EVENTS first (a sale happens → cash is collected → revenue is recognized → commission is paid). Then every departmental view derives from those same events.

So when Finance shows €50K payroll cost, you can trace it back to exactly which employees generated that cost. No more "where did this number come from?"

**Who it's for:**

✅ BI developers who need test data that actually makes sense
✅ Consultants who demo reporting tools without exposing client data
✅ Data scientists building sample datasets for training
✅ IBCS© practitioners bridging the certification-to-implementation gap

**What you get:**

→ 5 business scenarios (SaaS, hotel, bakery, tiered SaaS, course platform)
→ 12 months of event-sourced data
→ CSV + JSON export (Excel, Power BI, Tableau ready)
→ IBCS-inspired visualizations included

If you work with business data and you've ever said "I wish I had a realistic dataset to test with"—this is for you.

Special offer: Use code PHTC2025 for early supporter pricing.

Would love your feedback, questions, or brutal honesty. What am I missing?

---

P.S. For my fellow IBCS practitioners: I built a dedicated landing page for you → tellingcube.com/ibcs

You spent €2K on certification. You know what good reporting looks like. But when you sit down to create real reports, you're still building Excel mockups.

This bridges that gap. Generate demo-ready data that reconciles across Finance, Sales, and Operations—in minutes, not days.
```

**Character count:** ~2,100 chars (LinkedIn optimal length: 1,500-2,500)

**Hashtags to add at the end:**
```

## 3. Twitter/X Launch Thread

**Timing:** Post simultaneously with Product Hunt launch OR 1-2 hours after

**Purpose:** Drive Product Hunt upvotes, attract developer/data audience

```
🧵 After 6 months, I just launched tellingCube on Product Hunt.

It generates realistic business data in under 3 minutes.

Here's why it exists (and why building "realistic" test data is harder than it looks): 🧵👇

---

1/ The problem:

You need realistic business data for a demo, training, or testing a BI tool.

So you open Excel and start typing numbers.

Revenue: €50K
Costs: €30K
Profit: €20K

Looks good... until someone asks "Where did these numbers come from?"

---

2/ The deeper problem:

In real businesses, EVERYTHING connects.

→ A sale creates revenue
→ Revenue creates commission costs
→ Commission creates payroll
→ Payroll creates cash outflow

If your test data doesn't model these relationships, it feels fake.

---

3/ This is why most "sample datasets" fail.

They're just numbers in a CSV. No underlying business logic.

Finance says Revenue is €50K.
Sales says Revenue is €47K.

Which one is right? Neither. Because they were made up independently.

---

4/ tellingCube works differently.

It generates **business events first**:
- Customer signs contract → Revenue event
- 30 days later → Payment received
- Finance recognizes revenue
- Salesperson earns commission

Then every view (Finance, Sales, HR) is calculated FROM those events.

---

5/ What this means in practice:

→ Sales revenue ALWAYS matches P&L revenue
→ Payroll costs reconcile to headcount
→ Cash flow ties to invoices and payments
→ Numbers make sense when a controller reviews them

Because it's not random—it's event-sourced.

---

6/ What you get:

✅ 5 business scenarios (SaaS startup, hotel, bakery, etc.)
✅ 12 months of consistent data
✅ CSV + JSON export (works with any BI tool)
✅ IBCS-inspired visualizations included
✅ Controller-validated data models

Generate a full dataset in under 3 minutes.

---

7/ Two ways to use it:

1) Broad: "I need realistic test data for Power BI / Tableau / Excel"

2) IBCS practitioners: "I'm IBCS certified and tired of building Excel mockups for workshops"
   → Dedicated landing: tellingcube.com/ibcs

---

8/ Why I built this:

I'm a former controller. I spent YEARS building mockups for demos.

Every time, I'd think "there has to be a better way."

So I built it. Using event-sourced architecture + controller-validated models.

It's what I wish I had 5 years ago.

---

9/ It's live on Product Hunt right now.

If you work with business data—BI dev, data scientist, consultant, analyst—I'd love your feedback.

What's missing? What would make this genuinely useful for you?

Code PHTC2025 for early supporter pricing.

---

10/ And if you're thinking "this sounds over-engineered for test data"...

You're right. It is.

But that's the point.

If the data doesn't feel real, your demo/training/test fails.

This is test data that feels real—because it's built like real data.

Let's build. 🚀

## 4. Response Templates

### Template A: "What's IBCS?"

**Question:** "What does IBCS mean?"

**Response:**
```
Great question! IBCS stands for International Business Communication Standards—it's a set of principles for creating clear, consistent business reports.

Think: grayscale charts, clear variance visualization (Actual vs Plan), no chartjunk.

It's popular in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and used by finance/controlling professionals.

tellingCube generates data that's structured to work well with IBCS-style reporting. If you're not familiar with IBCS, you can still use tellingCube for any BI/data viz tool—the "IBCS" part is just an optional landing page for practitioners.

More info: ibcs.com
```

---

### Template B: "How is this different from faker.js or Mockaroo?"

**Question:** "How is this different from existing fake data generators?"

**Response:**
```
Good question! Mockaroo/faker are great for generating ROWS of data (names, emails, addresses).

tellingCube generates BUSINESS LOGIC.

The difference:
- faker.js: "Generate 1000 rows of customer names and emails"
- tellingCube: "Generate a business where customers sign contracts → make payments → trigger revenue recognition → create commission costs"

So if you need a realistic BUSINESS DATASET where Finance, Sales, and Operations all reconcile—tellingCube.

If you need a realistic USER TABLE for testing a signup form—faker.js.

Different problems. Both useful!
```

---

### Template C: "Is the data actually realistic?"

**Question:** "Are these realistic numbers or just random?"

**Response:**
```
Great question—this was my #1 priority.

The data models were validated by finance professionals with 10+ years of controlling experience. Here's what that means:

✅ Revenue growth curves follow realistic SaaS patterns (not linear)
✅ Payroll scales with headcount (not randomly)
✅ Gross margins stay consistent with industry benchmarks
✅ Seasonality patterns match real business cycles
✅ Cash collection follows realistic payment terms (Net 30, etc.)

Is it PERFECT? No—it's generated data. But a controller reviewing it should say "these numbers make sense" not "where did this come from?"

That's the bar we're aiming for.
```

---

### Template D: "What's your pricing model?"

**Question:** "Is this free? What's the business model?"

**Response:**
```
tellingCube is a one-time purchase (no subscription).

Pricing tiers:
→ Solo: €29 (1 user, personal use)
→ Team: €99 (5 users, commercial use)
→ Team Plus: €599 (unlimited users, priority support)

Why one-time? Because I hate subscriptions for tools I use occasionally.

You buy it once, use it whenever you need realistic test data. No monthly fees, no seat limits after purchase.

Product Hunt supporters get early pricing with code PHTC2025.

Does this model make sense for your use case?
```

---

### Template E: "Can I use this data commercially?"

**Question:** "Can I use the generated data in client projects / for commercial purposes?"

**Response:**
```
Yes! Starting with the Team tier (€99), commercial use is included.

You can:
✅ Use generated data in client demos
✅ Include it in training materials
✅ Export and use in commercial BI reports
✅ Use for testing commercial software

The Solo tier (€29) is for personal/learning use only.

All data generated is GDPR-compliant (it's fictional, no real people) and you own the output.

Does that cover your use case?
```

---

### Template F: "Why should I trust you / How do I know this is legit?"

**Question:** "Who are you? Is this tool actively maintained?"

**Response:**
```
Fair question! I'm Mario, based in Vienna, Austria.

Background:
→ Former controller (corporate finance background)
→ Built tellingCube over 6 months using event-sourced architecture
→ Data models validated by finance professionals with 10+ years experience
→ Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma (modern stack)

Social proof:
→ Featured by Brian Julius (58K LinkedIn followers, IBCS certified)
→ Positive feedback from IBCS Institute community members
→ Active on LinkedIn: [linkedin profile]

I'm building in public and actively maintaining the tool. This isn't a side project I'll abandon—it solves a problem I personally had for years.

Questions about the tech or approach? Happy to go deep.
```

---

### Template G: "Do you have an API?"

**Question:** "Can I integrate this into my app via API?"

**Response:**
```
Not yet, but it's on the roadmap!

Current: Web UI → generate data → export CSV/JSON

Planned for Q1 2026:
→ API endpoint to generate datasets programmatically
→ Webhook support for automated pipelines
→ Custom scenario configuration via API

If you need API access, I'm prioritizing enterprise customers who can provide feedback. DM me or email contact@masem.at and let's talk about your use case.

Does that work for you?
```

---

### Template H: "This is cool! How can I support?"

**Question:** "This is awesome, how can I help?"

**Response:**
```
Thank you! 🙏 That means a lot.

Ways to support:
→ Upvote on Product Hunt (helps with visibility)
→ Share with anyone who works with business data
→ Give honest feedback—what's missing? What would make this better?
→ If you use it, post a screenshot and tag me (best marketing)

And if tellingCube saves you hours of building mockups, consider buying a license. Solo tier is €29—less than 1 hour of consulting rates, but it funds development.

Really appreciate you asking. Let's build something useful together!

```
📊 Launch Update: tellingCube hit [#X] on Product Hunt yesterday.

Here's what I learned from talking to 50+ people about realistic business data:

→ Everyone has built Excel mockups they're embarrassed to show
→ "Consistent test data" is a bigger pain point than I thought
→ BI developers need this weekly, not monthly
→ IBCS practitioners are HUNGRY for implementation tools

If you missed yesterday's launch: tellingcube.com

Use code PHTC2025 for early supporter pricing (48 hours left).

And to everyone who upvoted, commented, or shared—thank you. This wouldn't exist without you asking "why doesn't this exist yet?"

Let's keep building.
```

**You're ready to ship. Let's get this live.** 🚀
