### Ring of Fire Sessions 🔥 (ROF)
**What**: A tellingCube innovation for BMad Method
**Purpose**: Multi-agent collaborative sessions while I work in parallel

**How it works**:
1. Start with `*rof "<topic>" --agents <list> [--report brief|detailed|live]`
2. Agents collaborate on scoped problem in the background
3. Agents come back for approval when they need tools
4. I choose how much detail I want in reports (default: brief + Q&A)
5. Get final proposals/results when session ends

**Key principles**:
- User controls the scope (small or big)
- Agents need approval for tool usage
- Flexible reporting (I prefer brief results with questions available)
- Enables parallel work streams

**Status**: Feature emerged from tellingCube project, to be contributed back to BMad Method community
