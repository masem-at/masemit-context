# 🎯 STRATEGIC BRIEFING: tellingCube Repositioning

**Date:** January 21, 2026
**From:** Mario Semper (Founder) & Claude (Strategic Advisor)
**To:** All BMAD Agents
**Status:** EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Read before any tellingCube work

---

## The Decision

After an extensive strategic session, we've made a fundamental decision about tellingCube's positioning:

**tellingCube is no longer an "IBCS tool for IBCS people."**

**tellingCube is now a "Realistic Business Data Generator for anyone who needs consistent test data."**

This is not a pivot. This is a correction. We were solving the right problem but talking to the wrong audience.

---

## Why We Made This Change

### The Evidence

**Brian Julius (55K LinkedIn followers) bought tellingCube for €29 and made a video about it.**

He didn't talk about IBCS. He said:

> "One of the things I've always had trouble with is developing realistic data that's **consistent**. That when you put it in visuals, it doesn't look crazy. **The numbers add up.**"

He compared tellingCube to a **Zippo lighter**: "Specific use, but one distinctive click instantly, reliably meets the exact need."

**Jürgen Faisst (CEO of IBCS Institute) privately told us:**
> "I'm skeptical if there's a commercial market outside of Open Source."

**But publicly on LinkedIn, he wrote:**
> "Relevant for **software vendors** and **BI consultants** who want to create mockups based on real-world models."

He named the real target audience. Not IBCS practitioners. Software vendors. BI consultants.

**The comments on Brian's post revealed actual buyers:**
- A Data Professional who "struggles for synthetic data to build POCs" — **signed up immediately**
- A Sr. Director at Plotly saying "we could have serious fun with this"
- Multiple people asking about the tool for testing and demos

None of them mentioned IBCS. Zero.

### The Problem With IBCS Positioning

IBCS is:
- A niche within a niche (Controllers → who know IBCS → who want to implement it)
- Not a buying reason — it's a "nice to have" feature
- Limiting our market to maybe 10,000 people globally
- Requiring explanation before value is understood

"Data that reconciles" is:
- A universal pain point (everyone who works with test data knows this)
- Immediately understood (no explanation needed)
- A buying reason (saves hours, prevents embarrassment)
- A market of millions (BI consultants, software vendors, trainers, developers, data scientists)

---

## The New Positioning

### One-Liner
> "Realistic business data that actually reconciles."

### The Problem We Solve
> "Synthetic data is either random garbage or takes weeks to build. AI hallucinates numbers that don't reconcile. Real data has compliance issues. You need realistic test data now."

### The Solution
> "tellingCube generates event-based business data where every view—Finance, Sales, HR—derives from the same transaction stream. No reconciliation errors. No data prep. Consistent, export-ready scenarios in minutes."

### Target Audiences (Priority Order)
1. **BI Consultants** — Client demos, POCs, prototypes
2. **Software Vendors** — Product demos that look real
3. **Trainers/Educators** — Workshops with realistic scenarios
4. **Developers/QA** — Test data without production data risks
5. **Data Scientists** — Statistically valid synthetic data for ML

### IBCS Role Going Forward
IBCS is now a **feature**, not the **product**.

✅ Acceptable: "Charts follow IBCS® visualization standards" (small print)
✅ Acceptable: Mentioning Jürgen Faisst for credibility (sparingly)
❌ Not acceptable: "IBCS-ready business data"
❌ Not acceptable: "You've mastered IBCS standards..."
❌ Not acceptable: IBCS in headlines or main selling points

## What This Means For You (Agents)

### Sophie (Marketing)
- Lead with "data that reconciles," not IBCS
- Target BI consultants and software vendors, not IBCS practitioners
- Use Brian Julius quote as primary social proof
- Mention hoki.help charity angle (authenticity signal)
- IBCS only as a footnote/bonus feature

### Dev Agents (Architect, Dev, etc.)
- Core engine stays exactly the same (this is our asset)
- Chart labels change from "Inspired by IBCS©" to "Data Preview"
- Navigation: Remove IBCS from main nav
- Landing page: New copy, same structure
- No changes to generation logic, validation, or export

### Mary (Business Analyst)
- Update PRD sections referencing IBCS as main positioning
- Target audience section needs revision
- Competitive positioning against AI/Excel/Random generators (not other IBCS tools)

### All Agents
- When asked about tellingCube's purpose, say: "Generates realistic, consistent business data for demos, testing, and training"
- When asked about IBCS, say: "Charts follow IBCS standards as a bonus feature"
- When positioning against competitors, compare to: ChatGPT (hallucinates), Excel (takes hours), Random generators (obviously fake), Real data (compliance issues)

## Key Messages To Reinforce

Use these consistently across all work:

1. **"Realistic business data that actually reconciles"**
2. **"3 minutes instead of 3 hours"**
3. **"AI hallucinates. tellingCube doesn't."**
4. **"Every € is traceable to a source event"**
5. **"3% goes to children's hospice"** (hoki.help)

---

## Social Proof Hierarchy

When citing validation, use in this order:

1. **Brian Julius** (55K followers): "The ivory-billed woodpecker of the data world"
2. **Jürgen Faisst** (IBCS Institute): "Relevant for software vendors and BI consultants"
3. **Early user testimonials** (as they come in)
4. **hoki.help charity model** (authenticity signal)

---

## What Stays The Same

Let's be clear: **the product is great.** We're not changing what tellingCube does. We're changing how we talk about it.

✅ Event-sourcing architecture — unchanged
✅ Mathematical consistency — unchanged
✅ 9 company profiles — unchanged
✅ CSV + API export — unchanged
✅ Chart quality — unchanged (just different labels)
✅ Generation speed — unchanged
✅ Pricing model — as planned in Big Bang doc

---

## Implementation Approach

We're doing **Brownfield + Umbau**, not Greenfield.

**Phase 1 (This Week):** Copy/Messaging changes only
- Can go live immediately
- Zero technical risk
- Tests new positioning with real traffic

**Phase 2-4:** Auth, Dashboard, Async, New Features
- As planned in Big Bang doc
- No changes to that timeline

---

## Final Note

This decision wasn't made lightly. We spent hours analyzing:
- Brian Julius's video and comments
- Jürgen Faisst's public vs. private feedback
- The actual buyers vs. the intended audience
- Market size of IBCS practitioners vs. data professionals

The conclusion was clear: **We built something valuable. We were just describing it wrong.**

Now we fix that.

Let's go. 🚀
