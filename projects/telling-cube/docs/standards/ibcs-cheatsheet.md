# IBCS Cheat Sheet – Scenarios in Tables & Charts

According to the **IBCS® standard**, up to **four scenario types** are used in tables and charts:

---

## Scenario Types (with abbreviations & visual style)

### 1. AC – Actual (current period result)
- **Meaning:** What really happened (booked figures).
- **Typical appearance:**
  - Bars/columns: **solid fill**
  - Color: **dark neutral** (e.g. dark gray or black)
- **Mnemonic:** **A = Actual = solid reality**

---

### 2. PY – Previous Year (comparison period)
- **Meaning:** Actuals from the **previous, comparable period** (e.g. last year).
- **Typical appearance:**
  - Bars/columns: solid fill, but **lighter** than AC
  - Color: **light gray**
- **Mnemonic:** **PY = Previous Year = lighter shade from the past**

---

### 3. PL – Plan (budget / target)
- **Meaning:** **Budget** or **target values** defined *before* the period starts.
- **Typical appearance:**
  - Bars/columns: **outlined only**, **no fill**
  - Color: same neutral tone as AC, but only the **frame**
- **Mnemonic:** **PL = Plan Line = only a frame**

---

### 4. FC – Forecast (updated expectation)
- **Meaning:** **Updated expectation** for the outcome of the period, based on latest actuals.
- **Typical appearance:**
  - Bars/columns: **hatched / striped**
  - Color: same neutral tone as AC, but with a **diagonal pattern**
- **Mnemonic:** **F = Forecast = filled with stripes**
