IBCS v1.2 – Extended Summary of Key Principles & Styling Rules
==============================================================

1. What IBCS Is About

---------------------

The **International Business Communication Standards (IBCS)** define a practical set of rules for:

* **Reports, dashboards and presentations** with business data

* Making charts and tables **clear, comparable, and consistent**

* Reducing “data decoration” in favor of **information clarity**

At the core, IBCS asks three big questions:

1. **What is the message?** – conceptual rules (**SAY**)

2. **What does it mean?** – semantic rules (**UNIFY** semantic notation)

3. **How should it look?** – perceptual and syntactic rules  
   (**EXPRESS**, **SIMPLIFY**, **CONDENSE**, **CHECK**)

Together, these map to the well-known **SUCCESS** formula:

* **S**ay – convey a clear message

* **U**nify – use consistent notation

* **C**ondense – increase information density

* **C**heck – ensure visual integrity

* **E**xpress – choose proper visualizations

* **S**implify – avoid clutter

* **S**tructure – organize content logically

The formal standard v1.2 structures these into **conceptual, semantic, perceptual, and syntactic rules** with numbered sub-rules (UN 1.x, SA 2.x, EX 1.x, etc.).

* * *

2. Conceptual Rules – SAY: Convey a Clear Message

-------------------------------------------------

Conceptual rules focus on **what you want to say**. The key idea: your charts and tables must serve a **specific, explicit message**, not just “show data”.

### 2.1 Know Your Objectives (SA 1)

* Clarify your **own goals**: What decision should this report support?

* Understand the **target audience**: executives, controllers, sales, etc.

* Choose the level of detail and complexity based on this audience.

**Practical implication:**  
Before designing a page, write down a one-sentence message like

> “Operating profit in 2024 underperformed plan mainly due to higher logistics costs.”

Then design everything around that.

### 2.2 Introduce the Message (SA 2)

IBCS encourages a **storyline** similar to situation–problem–question:

* **Map the situation** (context, baseline, previous period, plan)

* **Explain the problem** (gap, variance, issue)

* **Raise a clear question** (what decision or action is needed?)

This prepares the reader so the main message lands cleanly.

### 2.3 Deliver the Message (SA 3)

* Decide whether you **detect** (show what happened),  
  **explain** (why it happened), or **suggest** (what to do).

* **Say the message first**: put the central statement at the top of the page or slide.

* Support the message with charts/tables below, not the other way around.

### 2.4 Support the Message (SA 4)

* Provide **evidence**: numbers, variances, charts, and tables.

* Use **precise wording**; avoid vague terms like “good” or “bad” without context.

* **Highlight the core message** visually (bold, color accent, callout box).

* Indicate **sources** and **assumptions**.

* Link comments to the right objects (e.g., specific chart, line, or bar).

### 2.5 Summarize the Message (SA 5)

* Repeat the main conclusion at the end of the section or report.

* State **consequences**: implications for targets, budgets, or actions.

**Takeaway:** Every IBCS-compliant page is **message-driven**:

* headline = message,

* body = evidence,

* footer/side = explanations & references.

* * *

3. Semantic Rules – UNIFY: Apply Semantic Notation

--------------------------------------------------

Semantic rules define **what things mean** and require that equal things look equal everywhere.

### 3.1 Unify Terminology (UN 1)

* Use **consistent terms and abbreviations** across all reports.
  
  * Example: choose **“Revenue” vs “Sales”** and stick to it.

* Unify **numbers, units, and dates**:
  
  * Same decimal and thousand separators across all documents.
  
  * Consistent **unit notation** (% vs basis points, k vs M vs B).
  
  * Consistent date formats (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD` versus `DD.MM.YYYY`) within one organization.

**Goal:** The reader doesn’t have to re-learn notation in each report.

### 3.2 Unify Descriptions (UN 2)

This covers all text elements:

* **Messages**: similar types of pages should follow similar messaging patterns.

* **Titles and subtitles**:
  
  * Use a standard structure: e.g., _“Metric – Scope – Time – Scenario”_.
  
  * Titles should describe the **message**, not just the object (“Profit down vs plan due to X” instead of just “Profit”).

* **Position of legends and labels**:
  
  * Use a consistent placement (e.g., always above/below chart, or integrated in the chart).

* **Comments and footnotes**:
  
  * Unified style: same wording conventions and symbol system for notes and footnotes (e.g., asterisks, letters).

### 3.3 Unify Dimensions (UN 3)

IBCS distinguishes several core dimensions and asks you to standardize how you show them.

#### 3.3.1 Measures (UN 3.1)

* Use consistent **denominations** and **units** (e.g., `EUR m`, `k units`, `%`).

* Use consistent **scales** when comparing the same measure across charts.

* Make it obvious which measure each axis or column represents.

#### 3.3.2 Scenarios (UN 3.2)

Scenarios are things like **actuals, previous year, plan, forecast**.

* Use **standard scenario names and abbreviations** (e.g., AC, PY, PL, FC).

* Give each scenario a **consistent visual style** (shape/fill/pattern) so that:
  
  * “Actual” always looks the same everywhere.
  
  * “Plan” always looks the same everywhere.

* Scenario ordering is **logical and stable** (e.g., PY → FC → PL → AC or similar corporate standard).

> The exact colors/patterns are up to the organization, but once defined, they must be applied consistently in all charts and tables.

#### 3.3.3 Time Periods (UN 3.3)

* Time always flows **logically**:
  
  * In charts: usually **left to right** on the x-axis.
  
  * In tables: top to bottom or left to right in clear temporal order.

* Use consistent period abbreviations (e.g., `Q1`, `Q2`, `Jan`, `Feb`, `FY 2024`).

* Do not mix calendars (e.g., fiscal vs calendar) without clear labelling.

#### 3.3.4 Structure Dimensions (UN 3.4)

Structure refers to **entities** like regions, products, customers, segments.

* Always list structural elements in **consistent ordering** (by hierarchy or by value).

* If a hierarchy exists (e.g., Region → Country → City), follow it consistently.

### 3.4 Unify Analyses (UN 4)

Different analysis types (scenario, time series, structure, adjustments) should be standardized.

* **Scenario analyses (UN 4.1)**:
  
  * Scenario comparisons use the same scenario order and styles.
  
  * Use the same notation for **absolute** and **relative variances** everywhere.

* **Time series analyses (UN 4.2)**:
  
  * Charts of time series follow the same rules for axes, grid lines, and labels.
  
  * Ensure that a “time series” always looks like a time series (usually lines or columns).

* **Structure analyses (UN 4.3)**:
  
  * Composition analysis (e.g., by region, product) uses consistent chart types (e.g., bars/columns, not random mix).

* **Adjustment analyses (UN 4.4)**:
  
  * Show adjustments (e.g., for inflation, seasonality, one-offs) with standard notations and labels.

### 3.5 Unify Indicators (UN 5)

Indicators highlight special situations:

* **Highlighting indicators** (UN 5.1):
  
  * Mark important items consistently (e.g., same highlight color across all reports).

* **Scaling indicators** (UN 5.2):
  
  * When scaling is adjusted (e.g., compressed/zoomed axis), indicate that in a standard way.

* **Outlier indicators** (UN 5.3):
  
  * If extreme values are truncated or handled differently, clearly mark them with a standard symbol.

* * *

4. Perceptual Rules – EXPRESS: Choose Proper Visualization

----------------------------------------------------------

Perceptual rules focus on **how the human eye/brain best processes information**.

### 4.1 Use Appropriate Object Types (EX 1)

#### 4.1.1 Charts vs Tables

* **Charts** are better for:
  
  * Patterns, trends over time, and quick comparison.

* **Tables** are better for:
  
  * Exact values and when readers must look up specific numbers.

The standard defines several **table types**:

* Row header columns with compact labels.

* Scenario columns (AC, PY, PL, FC) arranged in consistent order.

* Numeric data aligned and formatted consistently.

#### 4.1.2 Chart Types (EX 1.1)

IBCS recommends:

* **Bars/columns** for comparing magnitudes of categories.

* **Lines** for continuous time developments.

* **Waterfall charts** for explaining changes (e.g., from PY to AC) via contributing factors.

* **Stacked charts** only when showing shares of a whole and when comparison is still easy.

### 4.2 Replace Inappropriate Charts (EX 2)

IBCS explicitly discourages several popular but misleading chart types:

* **Pie and ring charts**: hard to compare angles and areas precisely.

* **Gauges, speedometers**: visually attractive but information-poor.

* **Radar and funnel charts**: distort perception and are hard to read.

* **“Spaghetti charts”** (many overlapping lines): difficult to interpret.

* **Traffic light icons** (red/amber/green) as the main carrier of meaning:
  
  * If used at all, they should support, not replace, numeric information.

Instead, use clearer alternatives: bars, lines, small multiples, or normalized charts.

### 4.3 Prefer Quantitative Representations (EX 3)

* Use **numbers, bars, and lines** rather than icons or symbolic images as the primary information carriers.

* Avoid pure **text slides** in presentations; they should be supported by visual elements that actually show the numeric story.

### 4.4 Add Comparisons (EX 4)

Charts should rarely show a single number in isolation.

* Add **scenarios** (AC vs PY vs PL vs FC).

* Add **variances** (absolute and relative).

* Add **reference lines** or clear baselines where needed.

### 4.5 Explain Causes (EX 5)

* Use structures like **waterfalls**, tree diagrams, or cluster views to show **why** something happened.

* Visualize **correlations** and **clusters** when you want to support causal explanations.

* * *

5. Syntactic Rules – SIMPLIFY, CONDENSE, CHECK

----------------------------------------------

Syntactic rules handle the **visual “grammar”** of your pages: layout, density, cleanliness, and integrity.

### 5.1 SIMPLIFY: Avoid Clutter

#### 5.1.1 Avoid Unnecessary Components (SI 1)

* Avoid **cluttered layouts**: too many charts, boxes, shapes in limited space.

* Avoid colored or filled **backgrounds** that do not encode meaning.

* Avoid excessive **animation and transitions** in presentations; they distract from content.

#### 5.1.2 Avoid Decorative Styles (SI 2)

* No frames, heavy shading, or pseudo-3D where it does not add information.

* Avoid **decorative colors** that do not carry a semantic meaning.

* Avoid **decorative fonts**; use clear, readable typefaces.

> IBCS loves **minimalism**: if a visual element doesn’t carry information, it’s a candidate for removal.

#### 5.1.3 Use Cleaner Layouts (SI 3)

* Replace dense grid lines and heavy axes with simple **data labels** where appropriate.

* Avoid unnecessary **vertical lines** in tables; alignment and spacing should structure the view.

#### 5.1.4 Avoid Redundancies (SI 4)

* Remove **superfluous words** from titles and labels.

* Avoid obvious terms (“in EUR”, “in millions”) repeated everywhere if already clear once.

* Avoid **repeated words** across headers, chart captions, and labels.

#### 5.1.5 Avoid Distracting Details (SI 5)

* Don’t label every tiny bar if the label adds no value.

* Shorten **long numbers** by scaling (e.g., show millions instead of full units).

* Limit labels to what is helpful for understanding comparisons and messages.

* * *

### 5.2 CONDENSE: Increase Information Density

The goal is to show **more relevant information on the same space**, without hurting readability.

#### 5.2.1 Use Small Components (CO 1)

* Use **smaller fonts**, but still legible.

* Use **compact elements**: tight bars, symbols, and label placements.

* Keep visual objects small so more of them fit on one page.

#### 5.2.2 Maximize Use of Space (CO 2)

* Narrow **page margins** when it helps fit relevant content.

* Reduce **empty space** that does not help reading or grouping.

#### 5.2.3 Add Data (CO 3)

* Enrich charts with **additional data points** (e.g., min/max, average) where useful.

* Add further **dimensions** (e.g., scenario, structure) carefully, but only if they support the message.

#### 5.2.4 Add Elements (CO 4)

* Use **overlay charts** (e.g., bars + line) to show complementary information.

* Use **multi-tier charts** (e.g., stacked bars with additional lines).

* Extend charts and integrate them into **tables** where that improves readability.

* Embed short **explanations** inside the visual (callouts, annotation lines).

#### 5.2.5 Add Objects (CO 5)

* Show **small multiples**: many comparable small charts instead of one large overloaded chart.

* Place related charts on a **single page** for direct comparison.

* Combine **charts and tables** on one page when that helps understanding.

* Integrate charts and tables into **text pages** where they are needed to support arguments.

> Condensing is not about “cramming”, but about **using every square centimeter for meaning**, not decoration.

* * *

### 5.3 CHECK: Ensure Visual Integrity

CHECK rules protect against **misleading visuals**.

#### 5.3.1 Avoid Manipulated Axes (CH 1)

* Avoid **truncated axes** that start far above zero if they distort perception.

* Avoid **logarithmic axes** in common management reports unless absolutely necessary and clearly explained.

* Avoid **unequal class sizes** in histograms or grouped charts that make comparisons unfair.

#### 5.3.2 Avoid Manipulated Visual Elements (CH 2)

* Do not clip bars or shapes so that their lengths/areas become visually misleading.

* Use **creative but honest solutions** for challenging data (e.g., clear “break” indicators where axis breaks are unavoidable).

#### 5.3.3 Avoid Misleading Representations (CH 3)

* Ensure **area and volume comparisons** reflect actual numeric relationships.

* Avoid misleading **colored areas in maps** when the color scale suggests a disproportion that isn’t in the data.

#### 5.3.4 Use the Same Scales (CH 4)

* Use identical scales for identical units across comparable charts.

* Where scaling differs, clearly show **scaling indicators**.

* Use **outlier indicators** when a small number of extreme values would otherwise dominate the scale and hide variation.

#### 5.3.5 Show Data Adjustments (CH 5)

* If you show **inflation-adjusted** values (real vs nominal), clearly indicate which is which and how the adjustment was done.

* Similarly, indicate other adjustments (seasonal, currency, one-offs).

* * *

6. Practical Styling Guidelines (IBCS-Inspired)

-----------------------------------------------

This section condenses the rules into actionable styling guidelines you can use as a **design checklist**.

### 6.1 Typography & Numbers

* Use a **clear, sans-serif font** consistently (e.g., one corporate typeface).

* Use a limited **font size ladder**:
  
  * Title (largest), subtitle, chart/table headers, axis labels, data labels, footnotes.

* Align **numbers right** in tables; align text left.

* Use consistent **number formats**:
  
  * Same decimal places for similar measures.
  
  * Same thousands separators and currency notation.
  
  * Negative numbers always in the same style (minus sign, not parentheses in one place and minus elsewhere).

* Use **scaling** (e.g., `EUR m`) to avoid very long numbers.

### 6.2 Color & Highlighting

* Keep a **small base palette**, often grayscale + 1–2 accent colors:
  
  * Base elements in neutral tones (grey/black).
  
  * Accent color for highlights and key message elements.

* Use color **semantically**, not decoratively:
  
  * Same scenario → same style everywhere.
  
  * Same type of highlight (e.g., “exceptional value”) → same color or symbol.

* Avoid strong saturated backgrounds; use **white or very light** backgrounds.

### 6.3 Layout & Structure

* Think in **consistent grids**:
  
  * Align charts and tables along invisible columns and rows.
  
  * Use consistent spacing between elements.

* Place **titles** at the top, ideally phrased as messages.

* Group related content together; separate unrelated content with spacing, not random lines or boxes.

* Use **small multiples** instead of one huge, cluttered chart.

### 6.4 Charts

* Default to **bar/column charts** for comparisons and **line charts** for time.

* Use **waterfall charts** for “from–to” explanations.

* Avoid pies, gauges, fancy shapes and 3D effects.

* Align axes and scales so that comparisons are intuitive; avoid “tricks” that make small differences look big.

* Label only what helps understanding; avoid over-labelling.

### 6.5 Tables

* One **row header column** on the left, clearly separated from numeric columns.

* Scenario columns in consistent **order and width**.

* Avoid vertical lines; **alignment** and spacing should structure the table.

* Use consistent **highlighting** (bold, accent color) to emphasize important rows or totals.

### 6.6 Dashboards & Reports

* Each page or screen should answer **one main question**.

* Keep navigation consistent: same sections on similar pages.

* Balance **overview and detail**:
  
  * Top: summary KPIs and key messages.
  
  * Middle: supporting charts.
  
  * Bottom/side: detailed tables, notes, and methodology.

* * *

7. How to Implement IBCS in Practice

------------------------------------

To really benefit from IBCS, treat it as a **company-wide standard**, not just “inspiration”.

1. **Define your corporate notation manual**:
   
   * Terms, abbreviations, unit formats.
   
   * Scenario styles (AC/PY/PL/FC).
   
   * Color palette and font usage.
   
   * Chart and table templates.

2. **Create templates**:
   
   * PowerPoint master slides or reporting templates.
   
   * Excel or BI tool templates with IBCS-compliant charts/tables.
   
   * Dashboard layout patterns.

3. **Train users**:
   
   * Controllers, analysts, and designers in IBCS basics.
   
   * Show before/after examples to make the benefits visible.

4. **Introduce quality checks**:
   
   * Review important reports against **UNIFY, SAY, EXPRESS, SIMPLIFY, CONDENSE, CHECK**.
   
   * Over time, build a library of **good examples**.

5. **Iterate and refine**:
   
   * Adjust standards as you learn what works in your organization.
   
   * Keep consistency, but allow controlled evolution.
