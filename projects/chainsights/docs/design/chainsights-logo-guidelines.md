# ChainSights Logo Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Designer:** Pixel Chen (BMAD)

## Logo Concept

The ChainSights mark visualizes **identity resolution** — the core differentiator of the platform. Scattered wallet nodes converge toward a central "revealed identity," representing the transformation from anonymous addresses to understood participants.

**Visual Story:** Many wallets → One truth

## Color Specifications

### Primary Palette

| Color | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| Navy Blue | `#0F2C55` | 15, 44, 85 | Primary brand color, text, outer nodes |
| Azure | `#4A89F3` | 74, 137, 243 | Connection lines, secondary elements |
| Aqua | `#00E5C0` | 0, 229, 192 | Accent, "Sights" text, identity node |
| Violet | `#B84EFF` | 184, 78, 255 | CTAs, alerts (use sparingly) |

### Neutral Palette

| Color | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| Light Gray | `#F5F7FA` | 245, 247, 250 | Backgrounds, reversed logo nodes |
| Dark | `#1A1F2E` | 26, 31, 46 | Text on light, dark mode backgrounds |

### Color Rules

- **Aqua is the differentiator** — always present in full-color applications
- Navy + Aqua = ChainSights recognition
- Violet reserved for interactive elements (buttons, alerts), never in logo

---

## Typography

### Logo Wordmark

- **Font:** Montserrat Semi-Bold (600)
- **Letter-spacing:** -0.5px
- **Treatment:** "Chain" in Navy, "Sights" in Aqua

### Brand Typography (UI/Documents)

| Use | Font | Weight |
|-----|------|--------|
| Headlines | Montserrat | Bold (700) |
| Subheadings | Montserrat | Semi-Bold (600) |
| Body | Inter | Regular (400) |
| Data/Code | Roboto Mono | Regular (400) |

---

## Minimum Sizes

| Variant | Minimum Width | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Primary Logo | 140px | Below this, use icon only |
| Icon/Mark | 24px | Test rendering at 16px for favicons |
| Horizontal | 120px | For tight navigation spaces |

### Favicon Considerations

At 16x16px and 32x32px, the connection lines may not render cleanly. For favicon use:
- Use the icon variant
- Test actual rendering in browser tabs
- Consider a simplified favicon variant if lines create visual noise

---

## Clear Space

Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the central identity node (the "C" in ChainSights for the full logo).

```
    [clear space]
         |
    +----|----+
    |    v    |
    |  LOGO   |  ← Clear space on all sides
    |         |
    +---------+
```

**Minimum clear space:** 8px at standard sizes

---

## Usage Rules

### Do

- Use provided SVG files (they scale infinitely)
- Maintain aspect ratios when resizing
- Use reversed version on dark backgrounds (#1A1F2E or darker)
- Use monochrome when color printing is unavailable
- Let the logo breathe with adequate clear space

### Don't

- Stretch or distort the logo
- Change the colors outside the defined palette
- Add effects (shadows, glows, bevels) beyond what's in the SVG
- Place on busy backgrounds without sufficient contrast
- Recreate the logo — always use provided files
- Rotate or angle the logo
- Outline or stroke the logo

---

## Background Usage

| Background | Logo Version |
|------------|--------------|
| White / Light (#F5F7FA) | Primary or Monochrome |
| Navy (#0F2C55) | Reversed |
| Dark (#1A1F2E) | Reversed |
| Photography | Reversed with semi-transparent dark overlay |
| Colored backgrounds | Test contrast — prefer reversed if in doubt |

**Contrast requirement:** Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for accessibility (WCAG AA)

## Application Examples

### Website Header
- Use: Horizontal variant (200x40)
- Placement: Top-left, with navigation to the right
- Clear space: 16px minimum from edges

### Favicon / Browser Tab
- Use: Icon variant, exported as .ico or .png
- Sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48
- Note: Test rendering — simplify if needed

### Social Media Avatar
- Use: Icon variant
- Platform sizes: Twitter/X (400x400), Discord (128x128), LinkedIn (300x300)
- The mark works well in circular crops

### PDF Reports
- Use: Primary variant in header
- Placement: Top-left or centered
- Size: 140-200px width

### Email Signature
- Use: Horizontal variant
- Size: 150px width maximum
- Note: Test in Outlook — image compression can degrade quality

## File Formats

The provided SVGs are the source of truth. Export as needed:

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| SVG | Web, scalable applications |
| PNG | Social media, email, documents |
| ICO | Favicon (multi-size container) |
| PDF | Print materials |

**Export settings for PNG:**
- 2x resolution for retina displays
- Transparent background unless specific use requires solid

---

## Brand Voice Connection

The logo embodies "Wallets lie. We don't."

- **Scattered nodes** = the lie (inflated wallet counts)
- **Central identity** = the truth (real participation)
- **Aqua glow** = clarity, insight, revelation

When presenting the brand, the visual and verbal should reinforce each other.
