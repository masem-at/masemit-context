# Story 10.1: Seed Outreach to 3 Target DAOs

## Story Info
- **Epic:** 10 - Marketing Sprint 0 (First Revenue Focus)
- **Status:** ready-for-dev
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - First revenue blocker
- **Owner:** Mario (with Maya's templates)

---

## User Story

**As** the ChainSights founder,
**I want** to reach out to 3 carefully selected DAOs with personalized governance insights,
**So that** I can start conversations that lead to our first paying customer.

---

## Context

We have a fully functional product but zero distribution. The fastest path to first revenue is direct, personalized outreach that leads with value, not a sales pitch.

---

## Target DAO Selection Criteria

Pick DAOs that:
1. Score in the **6.0 - 8.0 range** (room to improve, but not struggling)
2. Have **active governance** (recent proposals in last 30 days)
3. Have **accessible governance leads** (findable on Twitter/Discord)
4. Are **mid-size** (not too big to ignore you, not too small to pay)

### Recommended Targets (from leaderboard):
1. **[DAO 1]** - Score: X.X - Why: [specific reason]
2. **[DAO 2]** - Score: X.X - Why: [specific reason]
3. **[DAO 3]** - Score: X.X - Why: [specific reason]

## Outreach Message Template

```
Hey [Name/DAO],

I built a governance health scoring system that analyzes on-chain voting patterns.
[DAO Name] scores [X.X/10] - your [specific metric] is particularly [strong/interesting].

One thing I noticed: [ONE specific insight that shows you actually analyzed them]

Thought you might find it useful: [link to their ranking on chainsights.one]

No pitch, just sharing data. Happy to explain the methodology if curious.

- Mario

## Maya's Notes

> "The goal isn't to close a sale. It's to START A CONVERSATION. One genuine reply can cascade into your first customer, a retweet, or an intro to someone else. Plant seeds, don't harvest."
