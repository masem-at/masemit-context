# Leaderboard Model Clarification

## The Misunderstanding

The team proposed "Phase 2 in 2-3 months" for community/customer reports. But here's the thing: **paid custom reports are already available today** (€49-149). There's no need to wait months for customer DAOs to appear on the leaderboard.

## How It Actually Works

### Current Reality

| Report Type | Price | GVS Score Created | Leaderboard Eligible |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Demo/Marketing Analysis (by ChainSights) | Free (internal) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes – "Featured Analysis" |
| Customer Report | €49-149 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes – with customer opt-in |

**Both paths create GVS scores using the same methodology. Both can feed the leaderboard immediately.**

## Corrected Leaderboard Model

### At Launch (Now)

```
🏆 DAO Governance Leaderboard

#1  ENS DAO        67  [Featured Analysis]
#2  Gitcoin        74  [Customer Report]  ← Customer opted in
#3  Compound       61  [Featured Analysis]
#4  Aave           58  [Customer Report]  ← Customer opted in

────────────────────────────────────────────
📊 Get your DAO scored → €49
   ☑️ Include in public leaderboard (optional)
```

### Two Badge Types

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Featured Analysis** | ChainSights analyzed this DAO proactively (demo, marketing, research) |
| **Customer Report** | A paying customer commissioned this report and consented to public listing |

Both use identical GVS methodology. No quality difference – just transparency about origin.

## Customer Opt-In Flow

### During Purchase

When a customer orders a Governance Report, include this option:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ORDER: Governance Report for [DAO Name]                │
│                                                         │
│  ☑️  List my DAO on the ChainSights Leaderboard         │
│      (Free exposure – recommended)                      │
│                                                         │
│  ℹ️  Your GVS score will appear publicly. You can       │
│     request removal anytime.                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Value Proposition for Customers

**Why opt in?**
- Free visibility for their DAO
- Credibility signal ("independently scored")
- Benchmark against other DAOs
- Shareable ranking for their community

**Why opt out?**
- Internal analysis only (board/investors)
- Score is low and needs improvement first
- Privacy preference

## What "Phase 2" Should Actually Mean

Instead of "community rankings in 2-3 months," the real Phase 2 features are:

| Feature | Description | Timeline |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Free GVS Quick-Check** | Score-only lookup (no full report) as lead generation | Month 2 |
| **API Access** | Programmatic GVS queries for integrations | Month 3 |
| **Self-Service Dashboard** | DAOs track their own score over time | Month 4+ |
| **Historical Tracking** | Show GVS trend (↗ improving, ↘ declining) | Month 3 |

These are product expansions, not prerequisites for customer inclusion.

---

## Summary

| Original Assumption | Correction |
|---------------------|------------|
| "Phase 1 = only Mario's analyses" | ❌ Wrong – customer reports can be included from day one |
| "Phase 2 = community in 2-3 months" | ❌ Wrong – customers ARE the community; they're already paying |
| "Need separate system for customers" | ❌ Wrong – same GVS methodology, just add opt-in checkbox |

### The Simple Truth

**Every GVS score we create – whether for marketing or for a paying customer – can appear on the leaderboard if appropriate consent exists.**

- Our own analyses → automatic inclusion (we control it)
- Customer reports → opt-in at purchase (they control it)

No waiting. No separate phases. Just one leaderboard with transparent badging.

## Action Items

1. **Update order form** – Add leaderboard opt-in checkbox
2. **Create two badge designs** – "Featured Analysis" + "Customer Report"
3. **Draft opt-out policy** – 24-hour removal guarantee
4. **Launch leaderboard** – With whatever DAOs we have scores for today
