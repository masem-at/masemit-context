# ChainSights — User Discovery

**Date:** December 15, 2025  
**Context:** Defining the ideal first customer for ChainSights Governance Reports

---

## 1. My First Customer — A Specific Person

**Name:** Let's call her Elena.

**Role:** Governance Lead / Core Contributor at a mid-sized DeFi protocol DAO.

**Her Day:**

- Morning: Checks Discord for governance discussions, replies to proposals
- Midday: Prepares a governance update for the community call
- Afternoon: Reviews voting results from last week's proposal
- Evening: Writes a forum post explaining why a controversial proposal passed with "only" 12% participation

**Her Frustration:**

Elena keeps getting the same question from the community:

> *"Why do the same 5 wallets always decide everything? Is this even decentralized?"*

She *suspects* it's not actually 5 people — it's maybe 2-3 people with multiple wallets. But she can't prove it. She's tried looking at Dune dashboards, but they just show wallet addresses, not *who* those wallets belong to.

Last month, a Twitter thread accused her DAO of being "controlled by insiders." It went semi-viral. She had no data to refute it — or confirm it.

**Why She Reaches for ChainSights:**

She's preparing for a community AMA where she knows the "centralization" question will come up again. She thinks:

> *"I wish I had an actual report that shows the real participation numbers. Something I could share publicly. Something that either proves we're decentralized — or tells us we need to fix it."*

She Googles "DAO governance analysis" or "DAO decentralization report" and finds ChainSights.

€99 is nothing compared to the cost of another Twitter shitstorm.

## 2. Who Has Budget Authority?

**The Honest Answer:** It depends on the DAO, and it's often messy.

| DAO Size | Budget Decision Process |
|----------|------------------------|
| Small (5-50) | Usually 1-2 core contributors have discretion for small expenses |
| Medium (50-500) | Multi-sig with 3-5 signers, but <€500 often approved quickly |
| Large (1000+) | Formal proposal process, could take weeks |

**For €99:**

- In most DAOs with any treasury, €99 falls under "operational discretion"
- A governance lead or core contributor can usually expense this without a vote
- It's the cost of a nice dinner — not a procurement decision

**For €199-299:**

- Might need a quick "hey, I want to buy this" in a core team Discord channel
- Still not formal governance, but needs a nod from 2-3 people

**My Sweet Spot:**

DAOs where Elena (the governance lead) has a small discretionary budget OR can get quick approval from 2-3 other core contributors in a private channel.

That means: **Not fully decentralized operations yet.** Ironically, the DAOs that are *most* decentralized in their spending are the hardest to sell to. The ones with some centralized operational control are faster to convert.

## 3. What DAO Size Is My Sweet Spot?

**My Answer: Medium DAOs (50-500 active members)**

| Size | Problem Intensity | Budget | Decision Speed | Verdict |
|------|-------------------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Tiny (5-20) | Low — they know each other | Low | Fast | ❌ Don't need me |
| Small (20-50) | Emerging — starting to feel it | Some | Fast | 🟡 Maybe |
| **Medium (50-500)** | **High — can't track manually** | **Yes** | **Medium** | ✅ **Sweet spot** |
| Large (1000+) | Very high | Yes | Slow (weeks) | 🟡 Later, not MVP |

**Why Medium:**

- Big enough to have the "who's actually voting?" problem
- Small enough that one person (Elena) can make the purchase decision
- Treasury usually €50K-500K — €99 is trivial
- Often preparing for growth, want to "professionalize" governance
- MiCA pressure hits them — they're big enough to worry about compliance, small enough to not have a legal team yet

## 4. What Type of DAO Fits Best?

**My Ranking:**

| DAO Type | Fit | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **1. Protocol DAOs (DeFi)** | ✅ Best | Token voting, whale concentration is *the* issue, MiCA pressure, treasury exists |
| **2. Investment DAOs** | ✅ Good | Treasury decisions matter, want to know who's really deciding |
| **3. Service DAOs** | 🟡 Okay | Governance matters less, more about work allocation |
| **4. Social DAOs** | ❌ Weak | Often less formal governance, less treasury, less pain |

**Why Protocol DAOs First:**

- They have the clearest governance pain (token voting = whale problem)
- They have treasuries (DeFi protocols often sit on millions)
- MiCA specifically targets them (decentralization claims matter for regulation)
- They're often accused of centralization on Twitter (reputation risk)
- Elena works at one of these

## My Ideal First Customer — The Full Picture

> **Elena, 32, Governance Lead at a mid-sized DeFi lending protocol.**
>
> Her DAO has ~200 active governance participants and a €2M treasury. They've been operating for 18 months and recently faced criticism on Twitter about "whale dominance" in voting.
>
> She's preparing for a community call and wants to address the centralization concerns with data, not opinions. She finds ChainSights, thinks "€99 to finally answer this question? Done."
>
> She buys the report, reviews it (finds out 3 entities control 58% of voting power — roughly what she suspected), and uses it in the community call. The transparency earns respect.
>
> Six weeks later, she recommends ChainSights to two other governance leads she knows in other DAOs.

## Summary: Who I'm Building For

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Persona** | Elena — Governance Lead |
| **DAO Type** | Protocol DAO (DeFi) |
| **DAO Size** | Medium (50-500 active members) |
| **Treasury** | €50K - €2M |
| **Budget Authority** | Discretionary or quick multi-sig approval |
| **Pain Point** | Can't prove/disprove decentralization claims |
| **Trigger** | Community criticism, upcoming AMA, MiCA concerns |
| **Price Sensitivity** | €99 is trivial, €299 needs justification |
