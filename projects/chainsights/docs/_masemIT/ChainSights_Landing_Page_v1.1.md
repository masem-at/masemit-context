## Problem Section

### The Problem with DAO Metrics

Every DAO claims to be decentralized. But when your dashboard shows "10,000 governance participants" — how many are actually unique people?

**The uncomfortable truth:**

- One person can have 50 wallets
- Whales split holdings to hide concentration
- "Decentralization scores" count wallets, not humans
- Top delegates often vote on less than 1% of proposals

Without identity-aware analytics, you can't answer the questions your community is asking.

## Solution Section

### Finally: Governance Metrics That Tell The Truth

ChainSights provides **identity-first governance reports** for DAOs.

We don't just count wallets — we analyze who actually holds power and how they use it.

**What makes us different:**

We distinguish between:
- **Whale concentration** (capital buying influence) — concerning
- **Delegate concentration** (community trusting leaders) — less concerning

That distinction matters. We show it. Others don't.

🔍 **Delegate vs. Whale Breakdown**
The insight nobody else shows: Are your top power holders trusted delegates or token accumulators?

📈 **Voting Patterns**
How engaged are your top stakeholders? Which proposals get attention and which get ignored?

## Sample Insight

> "ENS governance shows all top 20 power holders are **delegates** — trusted community members — not token whales buying influence. This is a positive sign for legitimacy.
>
> However, these delegates participate in less than 1% of votes. Power without participation is a governance risk."

## FAQ Section

### How accurate is the analysis?

We use Snapshot data and on-chain signals to analyze voting patterns and power distribution. We're transparent about confidence levels — we'll tell you "302 unique voters (high confidence)" rather than claiming false precision. Our methodology is documented in every report.

### Why €49?

A governance analysis typically requires 10+ hours of manual work. At €49, you're paying less than €5/hour for expert-level insights delivered in 24 hours. If one community question answered or one governance risk identified is worth €49, the report pays for itself.

### What if I don't like the results?

Then you learned something important. We report truth, not what you want to hear. That said, if the report is factually wrong or doesn't deliver what we promised, we'll make it right.

### Who's behind ChainSights?

ChainSights is built by masemIT e.U., an Austrian company. We're EU-based, GDPR-compliant, and building for the MiCA era. Our founder comes from enterprise software and believes DAOs deserve the same analytical rigor as traditional organizations.

### Can you analyze my DAO?

If it uses Snapshot for governance, yes. Other governance systems (Tally, on-chain Governor) coming soon. Not sure? Just ask — hello@chainsights.one.

### What about the €20 cashback?

Share your honest experience on Twitter (mention @ChainSights_one), send us the link, and we'll refund €20. Praise, critique, whatever — we honor it. Because if you're not willing to stake €20 on people sharing honestly, your product probably isn't good enough.
