## Email 3: Follow-Up (24h after delivery, if no engagement)

**Subject:** Quick question about your [DAO_NAME] report

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Just checking in — did you get a chance to review your governance report?

A few people have asked me:

**"What should I do with this?"**

Here's what other governance leads have done:

1. **Shared key findings** with their core team / multisig holders
2. **Used the Gini score** in community discussions about decentralization
3. **Implemented one recommendation** from the report
4. **Shared publicly** to build trust with their community

No pressure — just wanted to make sure you got value from it.

Questions? Just reply.

P.S. — The Share & Save offer (€20 back for a tweet) is still available if you found it useful.

## Email 4: Re-engagement (30 days later)

**Subject:** [DAO_NAME] governance — 30 days later

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

It's been a month since your ChainSights report.

Quick thought: Governance changes over time. New proposals, new voters, shifting power dynamics.

If you'd like an updated analysis, reply "UPDATE" and I'll send you a refresh at a special rate.

Same methodology, fresh data.

No pressure — just an option if it's useful.

## Email 5: Objection Handling — "Too Expensive"

**Subject:** Re: [Previous subject]

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I hear you — €49 is real money.

Here's how I think about it:

A governance analysis done manually takes 10-15 hours. At any reasonable consulting rate, that's €500-1500.

We do it in 24 hours for €49 because the process is (mostly) automated.

If one insight — one community question answered, one governance risk identified, one regulatory checkbox ticked — is worth €49, the report pays for itself.

If not, no worries. Maybe later.

## Email 6: Objection Handling — "Not Sure We Need This"

**Subject:** Re: [Previous subject]

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Fair question. Here's when you *don't* need a governance report:

- Your DAO has <50 voters (you probably know them all)
- You've already done this analysis internally
- Governance isn't a priority right now

Here's when you *do*:

- Community is asking "how decentralized are we really?"
- Regulators are asking (MiCA is coming)
- You're making governance changes and need baseline data
- You suspect whale concentration but can't prove it

If none of those apply, you're probably fine without it.
