## For Elena (After Receiving Report)

### Template 1: The Uncomfortable Truth
```
🔍 Just got our governance report from @ChainSights_one

302 unique voters out of 142,908 followers.

That's 0.2% participation.

Finally, someone told us the truth.

chainsights.one
```

### Template 2: The Key Insight
```
TIL our top 20 governance participants are all delegates, not whales.

That's actually good news — it means trust, not money, drives our governance.

Thanks @ChainSights_one for showing the difference.
```

### Template 3: The Wake-Up Call
```
Our top delegates participate in less than 1% of votes.

They hold the power but barely use it.

@ChainSights_one just gave us a governance wake-up call. 

Time to fix this.
```

### Template 4: The Recommendation
```
If you're running a DAO and wondering about your real decentralization...

@ChainSights_one separates whale concentration from delegate concentration.

That distinction matters more than I realized.

chainsights.one
```

### Template 5: The Simple Share
```
Got our governance report from @ChainSights_one today.

Decentralization score: 5/10
Unique voters: 302 (0.2% of community)
Top 20 concentration: 74.4%

But all delegates, no whales. That's the nuance that matters.
```

### Template 6: The Thread Starter
```
🧵 I just got our DAO's governance analyzed by @ChainSights_one

Here's what surprised me:

## For ChainSights Marketing (Build in Public)

### Teaser Thread
```
🧵 I analyzed ENS governance.

142,908 followers.
302 unique voters.

That's 0.2% participation.

But here's what's interesting — the concentration isn't from whales.

Thread 👇
```

### Data Drop
```
ENS Governance by the numbers:

• Top 1 wallet: 8.9%
• Top 5 wallets: 31.0%  
• Top 20 wallets: 74.4%
• Gini coefficient: 0.911

Sounds bad?

Plot twist: All 20 are delegates, not whales.

Context matters. That's why we built @ChainSights_one.
```

### The Distinction
```
There are two types of governance concentration:

1. Whale concentration — rich people buying influence
2. Delegate concentration — community trusting leaders

Most analytics show you a number.

We show you which type.

That's the @ChainSights_one difference.
```

### Uncomfortable Truth Series
```
Uncomfortable DAO truth #1:

ENS has 142,908 followers.

302 unique voters.

Top delegates vote on <1% of proposals.

Is your DAO any different?

@ChainSights_one — Wallets lie. We don't.

Governance analytics that tell you who actually controls your DAO.

That distinction matters.

```

When someone says "My DAO is decentralized":
```
How do you know?

Serious question — have you measured:
• Unique voters (not wallets)
• Participation rate
• Whether concentration is whale or delegate based?

Numbers don't lie. Wallets do.
