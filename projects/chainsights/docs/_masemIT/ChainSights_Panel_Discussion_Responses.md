## Panel Questions & My Answers

### 📋 To John (PM) — Pricing Psychology

**His Question:** "What's your answer to the pricing psychology question? Why €99-199 and not €49 or €299?"

---

**Why not €49:**

- Too cheap signals "automated garbage." If I'm promising truth about your governance, €49 says "we ran a script."
- Also: if I can't sell at €99, I won't sell at €49 either. Price isn't the real objection — trust is.

**Why not €299:**

- I have zero brand recognition. No case studies. No testimonials. €299 requires trust I haven't earned yet.
- €99 is an "let's see what this guy delivers" bet. €299 is a procurement decision.

**The real answer:**

- €99 is my validation price. If 5 strangers pay €99, I know the value prop works.
- €199 is for "I want the full analysis" — maybe more chains, more depth, or faster delivery.
- Once I have 10+ reports and testimonials? Then I can test €299.

And honestly? A DAO treasury with €100K+ won't blink at €99. That's a rounding error. The question isn't "can they afford it" — it's "do they believe it's valuable." Pricing signals confidence, and €99 says "I'm serious, but I'm not arrogant."

### 🏗️ To Winston (Architect) — Manual vs Automated

**His Question:** "Are you planning to manually review reports before sending, or fully automated? That affects scalability and quality control."

---

**For MVP: Semi-automated with manual review.**

Here's my thinking:

```
Automated:
- Data fetching (Covalent/The Graph)
- Initial analysis (heuristics + LLM)
- Report draft generation

Manual (me):
- Review for AI hallucinations
- Sanity check the numbers
- Final quality sign-off
```

**Why manual review matters now:**

- I don't trust AI output enough yet to send it directly to paying customers
- Each manual review teaches me what the AI gets wrong — I'll build better prompts over time
- One bad report at this stage kills my reputation before I have one

**The scalability question:**

- At €99/report with 30-60 min of my review time? I'm making €100-200/hour. That's fine.
- I don't need scale yet. I need *learning*.
- Once I've done 20-30 reports, I'll know: what always needs manual review vs. what can be fully automated

**Later:** Full automation with spot-check audits. But that's a Q3 2026 problem, not a Q2 problem.

### 🎨 To Sally (UX Designer) — Emotional Response

**Her Question:** "What emotional response are you designing for when someone gets uncomfortable truth in their report?"

---

**Not shame.** Shame makes people defensive. They'll reject the report, not act on it.

**The emotional arc I'm designing for:**

| Stage | Feeling | What the Report Says |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Opening | Curiosity | "Here's what we analyzed" |
| Findings | Uncomfortable clarity | "Here's what we found" (the hard truth) |
| Context | Normalization | "This is common — 70% of DAOs have similar concentration" |
| Agency | Empowerment | "Here's what you can do about it" |
| Closing | Gratitude | "You now know something competitors don't" |

**The key reframe:**

> "This report isn't judgment. It's a diagnosis. And a diagnosis is the first step to getting better."

I want them to feel like they went to a good doctor. Yes, the news might be uncomfortable. But they leave thinking: *"I'm glad I know. Now I can act."*

**Practically, that means:**

- Never frame findings as "you failed" — frame as "here's the current state"
- Always include "what good looks like" as a benchmark
- End every section with "what this means" and "what you could do"
- The tone is "trusted advisor" not "auditor with a clipboard"

**The ultimate compliment I want:**

> "We didn't like what we saw, but we're glad we know. And we're sharing this with our community because transparency matters."

If a DAO publishes my report publicly because they value the honesty? That's my marketing.

## Summary of Key Decisions

| Topic | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Pricing** | €99 (validation) / €199 (premium) | Low enough to try, high enough to signal quality |
| **Automation** | Semi-automated with manual review | Learning > scale at this stage |
| **Emotional Design** | Diagnosis, not judgment | Empowerment over shame drives action |
