# ChainSights — Share & Save Discount Strategy

**Date:** December 15, 2025
**Author:** Mario (masemIT e.U.)
**Purpose:** Viral growth mechanism through social proof incentives
**Status:** Panel-validated, ready for MVP implementation

---

## Executive Summary

Offer customers €20 cashback when they share their ChainSights report experience on Twitter/X. This turns every customer into a marketing channel while building social proof through authentic testimonials.

**Key Insight:** This is not cost-per-conversion — it's **cost-per-impression in the right audience**. Governance leads are a tight network. Compounding awareness drives long-term conversions.

---

## Why This Works

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Targeted Reach** | Elena's 800 followers = 400 Web3-relevant eyeballs for €20 |
| **Trusted Source** | Peer recommendation > paid advertising |
| **Compounding Awareness** | Month 1: notice → Month 3: remember → Month 4: buy |
| **Authentic Content** | Real experiences, not ad copy |
| **Network Effects** | Governance leads know other governance leads |
| **Low CAC** | €20 for targeted, trusted impressions (vs. €5-10 CPM for random crypto ads) |

**Why Twitter/X:** Governance leads ARE on Twitter. Discord is for coordination, Twitter is for reputation. DAO drama happens on Twitter.

---

## The Model: Post-Purchase Share

```
Flow:
1. Elena purchases report for €49
2. Elena receives report with "Share & Save" offer on last page
3. Elena receives follow-up email 24h later (reminder)
4. Elena tweets about her experience (honest, in her own words)
5. Elena submits tweet link
6. Elena receives €20 refund directly to her card (via Stripe)
```

**Why Post-Purchase:**
- Customer has real experience to share
- Authentic testimonials
- Higher quality content
- Peak satisfaction moment = highest share intent

---

## Brand-Defining Policy: Honor Criticism

> **"We'll honor the cashback even if your tweet includes criticism."**

This is not just a policy — it's a **brand statement**. It says: "We're so confident in our product that we'll pay you to tell the truth about it."

**On-brand with:** "Wallets lie. We don't."

## Manual Verification Process (MVP)

**Time:** ~30 seconds per verification

| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Tweet exists | Link works, not deleted |
| Mentions @ChainSights_one | Tag present |
| Public account | Not protected tweets |
| References report | Mentions governance/analytics/ChainSights |
| Genuine content | Not spam/bot behavior |

**Note:** Negative tweets still qualify. Authenticity > praise.

---

## Tracking Spreadsheet (MVP)

Log every verified share for V2 optimization:

| Date | Customer | DAO | Tweet Link | Followers | Engagement | Sentiment | Referral? |
|------|----------|-----|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-12-20 | Elena | Aave | [link] | 2,400 | 45 likes | Positive | Yes (1) |
| 2025-12-22 | Marco | ENS | [link] | 850 | 12 likes | Mixed | No |

**After 20-30 shares, analyze:**
- What follower count correlates with referrals?
- What content gets engagement?
- Is the 24h follow-up driving additional shares?

---

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Share Rate** | 20-30% of customers | Customer satisfaction indicator |
| **Time to Share** | <48h from delivery | Is PDF placement working? |
| **24h Email Conversion** | +10% additional shares | Is follow-up email effective? |
| **Referral Conversions** | Track any mention of tweets | Direct ROI indicator |
| **Sentiment Distribution** | Track positive/mixed/critical | Product feedback loop |

---

## Future Enhancements (V2 — If Share Rate >25%)

### Tiered Rewards

| Tier | Followers | Reward |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 🐋 Whale | >10K | €30 |
| 🐬 Dolphin | 1K-10K | €20 |
| 🐟 Fish | <1K | €15 or credit |

**Caveat:** A heartfelt tweet from a 500-follower governance lead might convert better than a lazy tweet from a 20K influencer. Quality > quantity.

### Other V2 Ideas

| Enhancement | Complexity | Impact |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Automated tweet verification | Medium | Faster processing |
| Referral tracking links | Medium | Better attribution |
| Leaderboard | Medium | Gamification |
| NFT badge for sharers | Medium | Web3-native flex |
