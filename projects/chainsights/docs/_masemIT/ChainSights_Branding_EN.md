# ChainSights – Branding Guide (EN)

## 1. Brand Positioning – Brand Values & Tone

Before diving into colors and fonts, let’s do a quick check: what values and associations should “ChainSights” convey?

### Possible Core Values / Attributes:
- **Trust / Security** – users should rely on your on-chain analyses
- **Innovative / Future-Oriented** – Web3, new technology
- **Accessible / Intuitive** – no-code, understandable for non-experts
- **Technical & Competent** – but not too nerdy or off-putting
- **Data-Driven / Precise**

These values should later be reflected in color choice, typography, imagery, and tone of voice.

## 2. Colors (Color Palette)

Web3 or crypto/blockchain projects often use combinations that suggest trust + tech + future: deep blues, purples, violets, complemented with neon, cyan, aqua accents (occasionally green or pink).

### Suggested Color Palette for Your Brand:

| Role           | Color / Hex   | Use / Function                             |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Primary Color  | `#0F2C55`     | Navy Blue – base tone, headers, backgrounds|
| Secondary Color| `#4A89F3`     | Azure – buttons, links, highlights         |
| Accent 1       | `#00E5C0`     | Aqua / Cyan – interactive elements, highlights |
| Accent 2       | `#B84EFF`     | Violet / Neon Purple – CTAs, accents, alerts |
| Neutral Light  | `#F5F7FA`     | Very Light Gray – backgrounds, card surfaces |
| Neutral Dark   | `#1A1F2E`     | Almost Black – text, dark sections         |

### Justification / Psychology:
- Navy blue conveys seriousness, stability, and reliability — a strong base for a data/analytics tool.
- Blue/cyan accents add a tech feel, freshness, and visual guidance.
- Violet/neon introduces a futuristic, Web3 flair.
- Light and dark neutrals ensure readability and visual balance.
- Use these colors with strong contrast to keep text readable over backgrounds (preferably WCAG-compliant).

## 3. Fonts / Typography

For a tech/SaaS/Web3 project, clear, modern, and highly legible sans-serifs are recommended. Many modern brands prefer geometric or neo-grotesque sans-serif fonts.

### Recommended Font Pairing:
- **Headlines / Logo / Titles:** Montserrat (bold / semi-bold) — geometric, clear, modern
- **Body / UI / Content:** Inter — optimized for interface/screen design, very readable

Some designers recommend combinations like Inter (for text) + Raleway (for headlines), or Montserrat + Merriweather for contrast.

### Suggested Setup:
- **Primary Typeface:** Montserrat (for headlines, large titles, accents)
- **Secondary Typeface:** Inter (for body text, UI components)
- **Optional:** Monospace/technical font (e.g., Roboto Mono or Fira Code) for data widgets, number displays, API docs

### Typographic Guidelines:
- Max 2 typefaces (plus optional monospace for special cases)
- Clear hierarchy: e.g., Montserrat Bold for titles, Medium for subtitles, Inter Regular for body
- Sufficient line-height for better readability
- Strong text/background contrast (dark text on light or vice versa)

## 4. Slogans / Claims / Taglines

You've already got a solid main claim:
> **“Actionable On‑Chain Intelligence for Web3 Companies”**

### Alternative Headlines:
- ChainSights — “Actionable On‑Chain Intelligence for Web3”
- ChainSights — “From On‑Chain Data to Real Insights”
- ChainSights — “Your Web3 Lens: Understand Wallets, Funnels & Whales”

### Sub-Slogans:
- “No-Code Analytics. API-First. On-Chain Clarity.”
- “Turn Blockchain Data into Business Insights”
- “Wallet Scoring, Funnel Tracking & Whale Alerts in One Platform”
- “On-Chain Insights for DAOs, NFTs & DApps”

### Tone / Style:
- Direct, clear, benefit-driven
- Avoid too much buzzword overload (e.g., “Actionable,” “Insights,” “Intelligence” are typical, but suitable here)
- Shorter variants for buttons or strong hooks:  
  “See your Chain”  
  “Know your wallet”  
  “Insight in blockchains”
