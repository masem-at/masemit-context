## Introduction: Why This Guide?

You've received a governance report — whether from us, another provider, or your own team. But what do all these numbers actually mean? How do you separate signal from noise? And most importantly: What decisions can you make based on this data?

This guide shows you what really matters.

## The 5 Core Questions Every Report Should Answer

Before diving into details, check if the report answers these fundamental questions:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Who is voting?** | A few whales or a broad community? |
| **How concentrated is power?** | Do 10 wallets control 90% of votes? |
| **Is there real participation?** | Or is it "governance theater"? |
| **What's the trend?** | Getting better or worse? |
| **What should we change?** | Concrete recommendations |

If any of these answers are missing, the report is incomplete.

## Key Metrics Explained

### 1. Voter Participation Rate

```
Formula: Unique Voters / Total Token Holders × 100
```

**What it means:**
- What percentage of eligible voters actually voted?

**How to read it:**

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| >30% | Excellent — active, engaged community |
| 10-30% | Normal — typical for DAOs |
| 5-10% | Low — apathy or information gap |
| <5% | Critical — "governance theater" risk |

**But beware:** A high rate isn't automatically good if only whales are voting!

### 2. Voting Power Concentration

```
Typical format: "Top 10 wallets control X% of voting power"
```

**The truth behind the numbers:**

| Metric | Healthy | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Top 1 Wallet | <10% | >25% |
| Top 10 Wallets | <40% | >60% |
| Top 100 Wallets | <70% | >90% |

**Critical distinction:**
- **Whale Concentration** = Large token holders
- **Delegate Concentration** = Large amounts of delegated voting power

A delegate with 20% voting power is different from a whale with 20% — the delegate was chosen by the community!

### 3. Gini Coefficient

```
Scale: 0 to 1
0 = Perfectly equal distribution
1 = One person owns everything
```

**For DAOs:**

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| <0.5 | Highly decentralized — unusually good |
| 0.5-0.7 | Decentralized — good distribution |
| 0.7-0.85 | Concentrated — typical for DAOs |
| >0.85 | Highly concentrated — oligarchy risk |

**Context matters:** A Gini of 0.8 can be acceptable if top holders are active delegates who operate transparently.

### 4. Unique Voters vs. Voting Power

```
Example:
- 1,000 unique voters ✓
- Top 5 voters hold 80% of voting power ⚠️
```

**What this means:**
Many people are voting (good!), but few are deciding (problematic).

**How to read it:**
- Don't just count wallets — weigh their power
- Ideal: Broad participation AND broad power distribution

### 5. Proposal Success Rate

```
Formula: Passed Proposals / All Proposals × 100
```

**Interpretation:**

| Value | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| >95% | Too high — are all proposals rubber-stamped? |
| 70-90% | Healthy — filter works but isn't blocking |
| 50-70% | Contested — active debate |
| <50% | Problematic — governance is gridlocked |

**Important:** A 100% success rate is not good news — it means either nobody disagrees, or controversial proposals aren't being submitted at all.

## Red Flags: When Should You Be Concerned?

### 🚩 Immediate Red Flags

| Flag | What You See | What It Means |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Ghost Governance** | 0 proposals in 3+ months | DAO is inactive or dead |
| **Rubber Stamp** | 100% approval, <5% turnout | Fake decentralization |
| **Whale Dominance** | 1 wallet >30% voting power | One person controls everything |
| **Trend Collapse** | Participation -50% vs. prior quarter | Community losing interest |

### ⚠️ Warning Signs (not critical, but monitor)

| Signal | What You See | Recommendation |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Declining participation | -10-20% vs. prior period | Improve communication |
| Rising concentration | +5% for Top 10 | Promote delegation |
| Few proposals | <2/month for large DAO | Simplify governance process |
| High abstentions | >20% "Abstain" votes | Write clearer proposals |

## What a Good Report Should Include (Checklist)

### Must-Haves ✓

```
□ Time period clearly defined (e.g., "Q3 2025" or "last 90 days")
□ Number of proposals and votes analyzed
□ Participation rate with historical comparison
□ Voting power distribution (Top 10, Top 100, Gini)
□ Distinction between whales and delegates
□ Clear visualizations (not just walls of text)
□ Actionable recommendations
□ Data sources cited
```

### Nice-to-Haves ⭐

```
□ Benchmark against similar DAOs
□ Individual analysis of key proposals
□ Delegate accountability scores
□ Trend forecasts
□ Voter segmentation (active/passive/new)
□ Governance attack risk assessment
```

### Red Flags in the Report Itself 🚩

```
□ No source citations
□ Only positive numbers, no criticism
□ Outdated data (>30 days old)
□ Key metrics missing
□ No actionable recommendations
□ Excessive marketing language
```

## How to Use Report Insights Practically

### For Community Calls

**Prepare 3 key statements:**

1. **The Headline Stat:** "Our participation increased by 15%!"
2. **The Honest Look:** "But 70% of voting power is held by 20 wallets."
3. **The Call-to-Action:** "We need to strengthen delegation."

### For Improvement Proposals

**Use data as your argument:**

> "According to our governance report, 47% of proposals had less than 10% participation. I propose we introduce a minimum quorum of 5% to strengthen legitimacy."

### For Investor Relations

**Show maturity through transparency:**

> "Our Governance Health Metrics show a Gini of 0.72 — concentrated, but comparable to leading DAOs. We're actively working on decentralization through our Delegate Program."

## Case Example: Reading a Report

### Scenario

You receive this report:

```
DAO XYZ — Governance Report Q3 2025
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Proposals analyzed: 23
Unique Voters: 1,247
Total Votes Cast: 3,891
Average Participation: 12.3%
Top 10 Voting Power: 67%
Gini Coefficient: 0.81
Proposals Passed: 21/23 (91%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Your Analysis

| Metric | Value | Assessment | Question |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|
| Proposals | 23 | ✓ Active | — |
| Unique Voters | 1,247 | ✓ Decent | How many are regularly active? |
| Participation | 12.3% | ⚠️ Low-normal | Trend vs. Q2? |
| Top 10 Power | 67% | ⚠️ Concentrated | Whales or delegates? |
| Gini | 0.81 | ⚠️ High | Typical or problematic? |
| Pass Rate | 91% | ✓ Healthy | Which 2 failed and why? |

### Questions You Should Ask

1. **What's the trend?** Is 12.3% better or worse than Q2?
2. **Who are the Top 10?** Known delegates or anonymous whales?
3. **What happened with the 2 failed proposals?** Healthy debate or gridlock?
4. **How many of the 1,247 voters are regularly active?** One-time voters skew the picture.

### Your Summary Template

> "The DAO shows solid activity with 23 proposals in Q3. Participation of 12.3% is industry-typical, but high concentration among Top 10 (67%) requires attention. Recommendation: Evaluate delegate program and make transparent who the top voters are."

## Questions to Ask Your Report Provider

When commissioning or receiving a governance report, ask these questions:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "Where does the data come from?" | Verifiability |
| "How current is it?" | Relevance |
| "Do you distinguish whales from delegates?" | Analytical depth |
| "Is there a benchmark?" | Context |
| "What do you specifically recommend?" | Actionability |
| "Can we get the raw data?" | Transparency |
