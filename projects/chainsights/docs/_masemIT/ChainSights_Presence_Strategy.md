# ChainSights — Web3 Presence Building Strategy

**Date:** December 15, 2025  
**Author:** Mario (masemIT e.U.)  
**Context:** How to build presence in Web3 from zero before launching ChainSights

---

## The Starting Point

- Zero Web3 network
- Only lurking on Twitter/Discord
- No followers, no connections
- Need presence BEFORE building product

---

## Phase 1: Silent Preparation (Week 1-2)

**Before you speak, prepare your ammunition.**

| Action | Time | Outcome |
|--------|------|---------|
| Set up Twitter/X profile with real photo, "Building ChainSights" bio | 1 hour | You exist |
| Follow 50-100 Web3 governance people (DAO contributors, Snapshot team, governance researchers) | 2 hours | Your feed becomes relevant |
| Read and save 20 great threads about DAO governance problems | 2 hours | You understand the conversation |
| Bookmark 5-10 tweets complaining about whale voting, governance issues | 1 hour | Future reply targets |

**Profile Template:**

> Mario | Building @ChainSights_one
> Identity-aware analytics for DAOs. Because wallets lie.
> 🇦🇹 Austria | Former insurance, now Web3
> 
> Ship #1: tellingCube.com (live)
> Ship #2: ChainSights (coming)

---

## Phase 2: Strategic Engagement (Week 2-4)

**Don't post yet. Reply.**

| Tactic | How | Why It Works |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| **Reply to DAO governance complaints** | "This is exactly why I'm building ChainSights — wallet counts are meaningless without identity clustering" | You're helpful, not promotional |
| **Add data to discussions** | "Fun fact from my research: 70% of DAOs have 3-5 entities controlling majority of votes" | You bring value |
| **Ask smart questions** | "Curious — has anyone tried clustering wallets by funding source to estimate unique voters?" | You're thoughtful, learning publicly |
| **Agree loudly with influencers** | Quote-tweet with insight: "This. And it's worse than people think because..." | You ride their reach |

**Rules:**

- 5 quality replies per day minimum
- Never shill ("check out my product!")
- Always add value (data, insight, question)
- Be yourself — the 45+ Austrian insurance guy entering Web3 is *interesting*

---

## Phase 3: Your First Content (Week 4-6)

**Now you've earned the right to speak.**

### The "Wallets Lie" Thread Template

```
🧵 Why every DAO metric you see is a lie

I've spent 3 months researching Web3 analytics.
Here's the uncomfortable truth nobody talks about:

1/ When a DAO says "10,000 governance participants"
— they mean 10,000 wallets
— the real number of humans? Probably 2,000-4,000

2/ Why? Because wallets lie.
- One person, multiple wallets
- Whale splits holdings to hide concentration
- Airdrops farmed across dozens of addresses

3/ I analyzed [DAO X] governance...
[Insert real data here]

4/ What this means for "decentralization":
[Uncomfortable truth]

5/ I'm building something to fix this.
ChainSights: identity-aware analytics for DAOs.
Because wallets lie. We don't.

Follow for updates. Launching Q2 2026.
```

**Why this works:**

- Leads with value (insight), not product
- Backs claims with research/data
- "Wallets lie" is memorable, quotable
- CTA at the end feels earned

## Phase 4: Build in Public (Ongoing)

**Your journey IS the content.**

| Content Type | Example | Frequency |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **Progress updates** | "Week 4 of building ChainSights: finally got Covalent data pipeline working" | Weekly |
| **Learnings** | "TIL: Clustering wallets by funding source catches 60% of multi-wallet users" | When relevant |
| **Struggles** | "Honest moment: identity resolution is harder than I thought. Here's what I'm trying..." | Occasionally |
| **Wins** | "First sample report done! Here's what I found about [DAO]:" | When they happen |
| **Austrian/outsider angle** | "Building Web3 analytics from Austria. No VC, no co-founder, just Claude and coffee." | Weave in naturally |

**The story you're telling:**

> "45-year-old Austrian insurance guy discovers Web3's dirty secret — wallet metrics are lies. Now he's building the tool to tell the truth. Follow along."

That's a story people root for.

## Phase 5: Strategic Networking (Month 2-3)

**Turn followers into connections.**

| Tactic | How |
|--------|-----|
| **DM governance leads** | "Hey, loved your thread on [X]. I'm researching DAO governance for a tool I'm building. Would you be open to a 15-min call? I'd love your perspective." |
| **Offer free analysis** | "I'm testing my governance analysis tool. Want me to run your DAO through it? Free, no strings. Just want feedback." |
| **Join DAO Discords** | Lurk → engage → become known → offer value |
| **Find your 5** | Identify 5 people who could be Elena (governance leads at medium DAOs). Build real relationships. |

---

## Phase 6: The Sample Report Launch (Month 3-4)

**Your big presence moment.**

1. Create a real governance report for a well-known DAO (Uniswap, ENS, Aave)
2. Publish it free as a Twitter thread + PDF download
3. Tag the DAO, tag governance researchers, tag critics

**The hook:**

> "I ran identity-aware analysis on @Uniswap governance.
> 
> Official stat: 5,847 voting wallets
> My finding: ~1,200 unique participants
> 
> Top 3 entities control 61% of voting power.
> 
> Full report (free): chainsights.one/uniswap
> 
> Thread 🧵👇"

**Why this works:**

If the findings are interesting, this will spread. Governance people love data. Critics will quote you. Supporters will defend. Either way: attention.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Presence

**It takes time.** 

You won't go viral in week 1. You might get 5 likes on your first thread. That's fine.

**What matters:**

- **Consistency** — show up daily, even just replies
- **Value** — every interaction should give something
- **Authenticity** — the Austrian insurance guy angle is REAL — use it
- **Patience** — 3-6 months to build meaningful presence

---

## Your Unfair Advantage

You're *not* a 24-year-old crypto bro. You're a 45+ professional who's seen enterprise, seen compliance, seen what "real business" looks like. That perspective is rare in Web3.

**Lean into it:**

- "I've spent 20 years in insurance. Here's what Web3 gets wrong about compliance..."
- "As someone who just entered Web3 at 45, here's what I see that insiders miss..."
- "Building this without VC, without a team, just me and AI tools. Here's why that's possible now..."

Your outsider status is a feature, not a bug.
