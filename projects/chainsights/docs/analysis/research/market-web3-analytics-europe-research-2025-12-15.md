## Customer Insights

*Scope confirmed by user on 2025-12-15*

### Customer Behavior Patterns

**DApp Developer Behavior:**
- Developers need both **onchain data** (transactions, wallet interactions, token activities) and **offchain data** (website traffic, social engagement)
- Heavy reliance on infrastructure providers like Infura, Alchemy, and QuickNode for node access
- Growing adoption of hybrid analytics platforms that unify onchain/offchain data
- Daily active wallets in Web3 reached ~26.4 million at 2024 year-end

**DAO Governance Behavior:**
- Research across **16,427 DAOs** and **122,307 proposals** shows over 60% of proposals fail to provide consistent descriptions
- DAOs exhibit oligarchic tendencies - decision-making power concentrates over time
- Governance tokens increasingly controlled by "whales," creating voting manipulation risks
- Growing use of AI tools like DeepDAO to analyze governance patterns

_Sources: [Cointelegraph DAO Governance](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/dao-governance-issues-and-challenges), [arXiv DAO Research](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.11758v1)_

**NFT Project Behavior:**
- **Less than 20% of wallet addresses control more than 80% of NFTs** on Ethereum
- Heavy reliance on whale tracking to predict market movements
- Large transfers to exchanges signal sell-offs; transfers to private wallets signal holding confidence
- Real-time alert systems increasingly critical for tracking whale movements

### Pain Points and Challenges

| Customer Segment | Key Pain Points |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **DApp Developers** | Surface-level testing misses edge-case exploits; Audits too expensive for frequent changes; Complex UX for non-technical users; Cross-chain fragmentation |
| **DAOs** | Whale concentration in governance; Low participation rates; Scalability of voting; Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts |
| **NFT Projects** | Whale manipulation; Fragmented data across marketplaces; Real-time tracking gaps; Attribution complexity |
| **All Segments** | **Fragmented user identity** (multiple wallets per user); Attribution across platforms/chains; Expensive enterprise solutions |

- Gartner predicts **25% of enterprises** will use centralized services wrapped around Web3 apps by 2027
- Key drivers: supply chain transparency, tokenized loyalty, decentralized identity

**Developer Segment:**
- Cost sensitivity is high - free tiers and community-driven tools favored
- SQL flexibility valued (Dune serves 6,000+ Web3 teams vs. competitors' institutional focus)
- **40% of blockchain startup funding** in 2023 went to Web3 data & analytics companies
- Preference for self-service tools over enterprise sales processes

**Primary Differentiators:**
1. DApp Funnel Analytics (unique in market)
2. DAO Governance KPIs (major gap)
3. EU-first / GDPR-MiCA compliant
4. No-SQL interface for non-technical teams
5. TypeScript SDK for developers

**Recommended Pricing Strategy:**
- Free tier (compete with Flipside)
- Pro: EUR 49-99/mo (match Nansen new pricing)
- Enterprise: Custom (compliance features)

**Target Customers (Priority Order):**
1. European DApps needing funnel analytics
2. DAOs requiring governance metrics
3. NFT projects needing whale tracking

### Next Steps
