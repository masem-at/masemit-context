# DAO Governance Leads - Direct Outreach Playbook
**Generated:** December 24, 2025
**Campaign:** ChainSights Rankings Launch - Direct DAO Outreach
**Goal:** Drive traffic through targeted outreach to governance leads who will share within their communities

---

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

**Why This Works:**
- Your scores are LOW (2-3/10) = controversial = engaging
- You're providing FREE value (governance health checkup)
- These are PUBLIC rankings - you're just notifying them
- Governance leads WANT to improve - you're offering insights

**Approach:**
- Lead with VALUE, not promotion
- Reference specific data (their power concentration %)
- Offer to explain methodology
- Make it easy to share

**Channels Priority:**
1. **Twitter DMs** - Fastest response, public-facing people
2. **Discord** - For community-focused delegates
3. **Governance Forums** - Most serious, best for detailed discussion
4. **Email** - Last resort, lowest response rate

Hey [Name] 👋

I built ChainSights - a free governance analysis tool for DAOs. Just analyzed Lido's on-chain voting data and wanted to share the results:

📊 Lido ranked #1 out of 9 major DAOs

Building in public, any feedback would be incredibly valuable 🙏

Hi [Name],

Built a governance scoring tool and ENS came out strongest of the 9 DAOs we analyzed:

✅ Ranked #2 overall
📊 Score: 3/10 (highest governance quality)
✨ Best power distribution: only 31% in top 5 wallets

See full rankings: https://chainsights.one/rankings

The GVS methodology weighs participation, delegate engagement, and decentralization. ENS is leading on distribution but there's room for improvement on engagement metrics.

Would be curious to hear your take - especially since ENS sets the standard others follow 🙏

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**Primary:**
- Responses from DAO leads: Target 5+ out of 9
- Shares/RTs from governance community: Target 20+
- Traffic spike: Target 500+ visitors from outreach

**Secondary:**
- Forum discussions started: Target 3+ DAOs
- Inbound DMs asking for analysis: Target 10+
- Follow-backs from governance leaders: Target 15+

---

## 💡 KEY TALKING POINTS

**When they ask about methodology:**
"We calculate GVS across 4 dimensions: Human Participation Rate (35%), Delegate Engagement Index (25%), Power Dynamics Index (20%), and Grassroots Participation Index (20%). All data comes from on-chain Snapshot voting analysis."

**When they disagree with scores:**
"That's exactly why I wanted to reach out - our methodology might be missing context. Would love to understand what we're not capturing. This is v1 and we're actively improving it."

**When they ask why you built this:**
"DAOs are running billion-dollar treasuries but governance quality data is opaque. I wanted to create the governance equivalent of DeFi Llama - transparent, open data that helps the ecosystem improve."

**When they're defensive about low scores:**
"The goal isn't to shame anyone - it's to provide data so DAOs can improve. Every DAO scored low (2-3/10) which shows there's systemic issues industry-wide. You're not alone in this."

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL DO's and DON'Ts

### DO:
✅ Lead with value and data
✅ Be humble about methodology
✅ Invite feedback and collaboration
✅ Reference their specific metrics
✅ Acknowledge you might be missing context
✅ Make it easy to share (clean links, visuals)

### DON'T:
❌ Be promotional or salesy
❌ Claim your scores are perfect
❌ Attack or criticize defensively
❌ Spam multiple channels at once
❌ Send generic copy-paste messages
❌ Ask them to promote you directly

---

## 📊 SAMPLE PUBLIC THREAD (if DMs don't work)

```
I analyzed governance health across 9 major DAOs 🧵

Used on-chain Snapshot data to calculate a Governance Vitality Score (GVS) looking at:
- Participation rates
- Delegate engagement
- Power distribution
- Grassroots activity

Results are... concerning 👇

[Rankings visual]

🥇 Lido: 3/10 (52% power in top 5)
🥈 ENS: 3/10 (31% power in top 5)
🥉 Arbitrum: 2/10 (34% power in top 5)

Full breakdown: https://chainsights.one/rankings

The pattern is clear: Even the "best" DAOs have serious centralization issues.

97% of Balancer's voting power sits in 5 wallets.
73% of Gitcoin's power is concentrated.
54% of Uniswap's votes come from 5 addresses.

This isn't to shame anyone - it's a wake-up call for the entire ecosystem.

The good news? We can measure it now. Which means we can improve it.

Would love feedback from the governance community:
@hasufl @nicksdjohnson @SinkasAB @BobbyDresser @erinkoen @SchorLukas @krrisis

What am I missing? Where is this analysis wrong? 🙏

**This playbook gives you:**
✅ 20+ specific people to contact with handles
✅ Personalized message templates for each DAO
✅ Multi-channel strategy (Twitter → Forums → Discord)
✅ Talking points for common objections
✅ Execution checklist with timeline

**Your job:** Start with Twitter DMs today. Personalize slightly but keep core structure. Track responses. Iterate based on what works.

Want me to help draft any specific message variations or research additional contacts for any DAOs?
