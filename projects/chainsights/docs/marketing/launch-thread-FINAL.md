## The Thread (6 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 - Hook
```
We analyzed governance data for 10 major DAOs.

The scores range from 7.5 to 3.3 out of 10.

Here's what the numbers reveal 👇
```

**Why this works:** Opens with specific data, creates curiosity about the range. No attack, just observation.

---

### Tweet 2 - The Surprise
```
The biggest surprise?

Score doesn't always match reputation.

Some "blue chip" DAOs scored Critical (3.3/10).
Some newer protocols scored Stable (7.5/10).

Governance health ≠ brand recognition.
```

**Why this works:** Challenges assumptions without naming names. Creates "wait, who?" curiosity.

---

### Tweet 3 - Specific Data
```
The score range tells a story:

• Top performers: 7.5/10 (Stable governance)
• Bottom tier: 3.3/10 (Critical - needs attention)

That's a 4+ point gap between DAOs you'd assume are similar.

The difference? Power distribution and participation patterns.
```

**Why this works:** Uses verifiable public data (scores from rankings page). Creates curiosity about WHY scores differ without citing unverified metrics.

---

### Tweet 4 - The Why
```
Why does this matter?

Because "decentralized" shouldn't be a marketing claim.

It should be measurable.

And when you measure it, you find real variance that affects:
→ Treasury decisions
→ Protocol upgrades
→ Community trust
```

**Why this works:** Positions ChainSights as the measurement tool. Stakes are clear. No hype.

---

### Tweet 5 - What We Built
```
That's why we built ChainSights Rankings.

Free governance health scores for major DAOs:
↳ Power distribution analysis
↳ Participation tracking
↳ Delegate vs whale breakdown

Updated weekly. No signup required.
```

**Why this works:** Clear value prop. "Free" and "no signup" remove friction. Lists tangible features.

---

### Tweet 6 - CTA
```
Check where your DAO ranks:

chainsights.one/rankings

Current leaderboard:
🥇 Lido - 7.5
🥈 Balancer - 7.5
🥉 ENS - 7.2

...down to 3.3 for some you might not expect.

Full methodology on the site.
```

**Why this works:** Specific link. Shows real data as proof. "Some you might not expect" creates click motivation. Methodology mention builds trust.

## Posting Strategy

### Timing
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times:** 9-11am EST or 2-4pm EST (peak crypto Twitter)
- **Avoid:** Weekends, Monday mornings, Friday afternoons

### Hashtags
Use sparingly (max 2-3 per tweet, only on tweets 1 and 6):
- Primary: `#DAO` `#Web3`
- Secondary: `#DeFi` `#Governance`
- Avoid: `#Crypto` (too broad, spam-heavy)

### Thread Posting Method
1. Write all tweets in a thread composer first
2. Post tweet 1, then reply to yourself with tweet 2, etc.
3. Pin the thread to your profile immediately after posting
4. Don't edit after posting (kills engagement)

### Engagement Rules (First 2 Hours)
- Respond to EVERY reply within 30 minutes
- Like all genuine comments
- If someone asks "which DAO is 51%?" - answer honestly (it's Lido, the data is public)
- If someone is hostile - don't argue, ask a question instead
- Quote-retweet positive responses with brief commentary

---

## Response Templates

### Template 1: "What's the methodology?"
```
Great question! We analyze four dimensions:

• Human Participation Rate (35%)
• Delegate Engagement Index (25%)
• Power Dynamics Index (20%)
• Grassroots Participation (20%)

All based on Snapshot on-chain data. Full breakdown: chainsights.one/rankings (scroll to methodology section)
```

### Template 2: "Why is [DAO] scored so low/high?"
```
[DAO]'s score reflects their current governance metrics, not a judgment on the project itself.

Lower scores often mean concentrated voting power or low participation - things that can change with the right initiatives.

Happy to share specific breakdown if you're curious.
```

### Template 3: "This is FUD / You're wrong about [DAO]"
```
Appreciate the pushback. We're always refining.

If you have context we're missing (recent governance changes, data sources we should include), genuinely want to hear it.

What specifically seems off to you?
```

### Template 4: "How much does a full report cost?" (If asked)
```
Rankings are free forever.

If you want a deeper dive (wallet clustering, historical trends, custom analysis), we offer paid reports.

But honestly, start with the free rankings - most DAOs never need more than that.
```

### Template 5: "Can you add [DAO]?"
```
Working on expanding coverage. [DAO] is on the list.

Which specific metrics would be most useful for your community? Helps us prioritize what to build.
```

## What NOT To Do

Based on Week 51 failure analysis:

1. **DON'T be confrontational** - "Balancer is a group chat with extra steps" killed our first thread
2. **DON'T tag DAOs aggressively** - Let them find us, don't force attention
3. **DON'T post and disappear** - Engagement in first 2 hours determines reach
4. **DON'T defend aggressively** - Criticism is data, not attack
5. **DON'T pitch pricing unless asked** - Value first, always
