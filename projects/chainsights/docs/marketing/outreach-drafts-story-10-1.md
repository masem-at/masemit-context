Lido Governance Health Analysis: 6.8/10 Score Breakdown
```

**Forum Body:**
```
Hey Lido team,

Built a governance health scoring system that analyzes on-chain voting
patterns across major DAOs.

Lido scores 6.8/10 - solid foundation, but I noticed something interesting:
your Delegate Engagement Index is pulling the score down. Top delegates
are voting, but mid-tier delegate participation drops off sharply after
the top 10.

Not a critique - just data. Thought your governance team might find it
useful for planning delegate incentive programs.

Full breakdown here: https://chainsights.one/rankings#lido

Happy to walk through the methodology if you're curious.

Arbitrum Governance Vitality Score: 6.9/10 - Analysis & Insights
```

**Forum Body:**
```
Hey Arbitrum governance folks,

I built ChainSights - a governance vitality scoring system that tracks
on-chain health metrics.

Arbitrum scores 6.9/10 - solid performance with room to grow. Your
Power Dynamics Index is particularly interesting: the distribution
of voting power across top wallets is healthier than most comparable DAOs.

One area that could boost your score: Human Participation Rate. Higher
engagement from unique voters (not just delegates) typically signals
stronger community involvement.

Full breakdown here: https://chainsights.one/rankings#arbitrum

No pitch - just sharing what I found. Always happy to nerd out on
governance metrics.

**Forum Title:**
```
ENS Governance Health Score: 7.3/10 - Strong Grassroots Participation
```

**Forum Body:**
```
Hey ENS team,

I've been building a governance health scoring system and ENS came up
as an interesting case study.

You score 7.3/10 - strong community participation. Your Grassroots
Participation Index is particularly notable - small token holders are
actually voting, which is rare. Most DAOs see sub-1% participation
from non-whale addresses.

This is genuinely impressive and worth highlighting in your governance
comms.

Full score breakdown: https://chainsights.one/rankings#ens

Built this to help DAOs understand their governance health. Curious if
the data matches your internal observations?

## Tips for Sending

1. **Verify the anchor links work** - Click each link before sending
2. **Adjust scores** if they differ from live data
3. **Send from @ChainSights_one** for brand recognition (or personal for warmth)
4. **Forums > DMs** for visibility - others see the value you're providing
5. **Don't send all 3 at once** - Stagger by a few hours

## Follow-Up Template (Day 5 if no response)

```
Hey [DAO] - following up on my governance data share from last week.

One additional insight: [NEW DATA POINT about their recent proposal or voting pattern]

No pressure - just thought it might be useful context for your governance discussions.

Hi! Thanks for the data — we’ll definitely review it and see what we can do.

Quick question: what did your research show? Are there any DAOs that significantly outperform Lido on this metric? Because intuitively, the lower a delegate's VP, the less consistently they participate - just a natural way of things.

## Draft Reply to Jenya_K (Lido)

**Status:** Ready for Mario to send
**Data source:** Fresh reports from Jan 18, 2026

```
Hey Jenya - glad this is useful! Took a bit to pull comparable data.

Short answer: delegate participation is brutal across the board - we're seeing 0.08%-0.84% at ENS, 0.01%-0.10% at Arbitrum, vs Lido's ~0.14%. So you're right that low VP = low participation is universal.

But here's where Lido differs from ENS specifically:

- **Power concentration**: Lido's top 5 wallets control 51.1% of voting power vs ENS at 31%. That's a meaningful gap.
- **Nakamoto coefficient**: Lido = 5, ENS = 11. Fewer entities needed to control Lido governance.
- **Voter breadth**: Lido has 151 unique voters vs ENS at 302 (2x more).

The participation *rate* problem is the same everywhere. The *concentration* problem is where Lido stands out.

One observation: ENS shows mixed voting outcomes (some proposals actually get rejected), while Lido's recent proposals are unanimous. Could be great consensus, could be insufficient opposition representation - hard to say from outside.

Happy to share the full reports if useful - ran fresh analysis on all three DAOs today. No pitch, just data.

### Why This Response Works

1. **Honest about the data** - Doesn't oversell; admits participation is bad everywhere
2. **Reframes the real issue** - Pivots from participation rate (where Lido is similar) to concentration (where Lido is worse)
3. **Gives specific numbers** - 51.1% vs 31%, Nakamoto 5 vs 11, 151 vs 302 voters
4. **Plants a seed** - "unanimous outcomes" observation invites reflection
5. **Offers value** - Fresh reports available, no pressure

### Data Summary (Jan 18, 2026 Reports)

| Metric | Lido | ENS | Arbitrum |
|--------|------|-----|----------|
| Score | 3/10 | 3/10 | 2/10 |
| Gini | 0.906 | 0.911 | 0.988 |
| Top 5 Control | 51.1% | 31.0% | 33.6% |
| Top 10 Control | 71.6% | 50.9% | 55.4% |
| Top 20 Control | 95.8% | 74.4% | 83.4% |
| Nakamoto Coeff | 5 | 11 | 9 |
| Unique Voters | 151 | 302 | 2,012 |
| Delegate Participation | 0.14% | 0.08-0.84% | 0.01-0.10% |

### Follow-up If They Reply

If Jenya engages further:
- Offer to send the full Lido PDF report
- If they show interest in the concentration issue, that's the opening for a deeper conversation
- The "unanimous outcomes" comment might prompt them to ask more - be ready with the voting patterns data
