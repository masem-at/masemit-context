# What To Do Now - Simple Answer

## STEP 1: RESPOND TO THE FEEDBACK

Post this reply:

"Totally understood - that's fair feedback. I'll contribute where it's genuinely relevant to the discussion.

And thanks for the formatting suggestion - really appreciate it. What specifically would you suggest for better presentation? Happy to improve.

Appreciate the constructive input."

## STEP 2: STOP COMMENTING FOR 1 WEEK

Don't post any new comments for 7 days.

Just read the forums daily.

## STEP 3: AFTER 1 WEEK

Check your original posts for views/replies.

Look for governance-specific discussions where your data truly adds value.

Only comment if it's really relevant (maybe 1-2x per month max).

## IS THE FEEDBACK GOOD OR BAD?

VERY GOOD.

They said:
1. Your analysis is interesting
2. They don't want you spamming (fair boundary)
3. They're HELPING you improve formatting (they want you to succeed)

Community members only give improvement suggestions to people they want to stick around.

This is positive, constructive feedback.
