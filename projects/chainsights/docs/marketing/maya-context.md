# Maya's Context — ChainSights Marketing Strategy

**Last Updated:** 2024-12-19
**Owner:** Maya Rivera (Marketing Agent)

---

## Current Situation (CRITICAL CONTEXT)

### Starting Position
- **Network:** ZERO - no warm contacts in crypto/DAO space
- **Social Media:** No followers, no presence
- **Customer Count:** 0 (no quiz submissions, no report orders)
- **Traffic:** Minimal (10 site visits from failed tweet thread)

### What We Tried (FAILED)
- **Week 51 Twitter Thread:** Confrontational content about DAO centralization
  - Result: 61 impressions, 0 engagement, thread died
- **Seed Campaign DM Outreach:** Reached out to high-profile targets (Sinkas, Lefteris, Nick Johnson, kpk, Wintermute, Areta)
  - Result: 0 responses
  - Why Failed: No credibility, confrontational approach, wrong starting position

### Key Lesson Learned
**MISTAKE:** Gave Mario a strategy for someone with existing audience/credibility when he explicitly said he's starting from ZERO.

Cold start problem requires different playbook:
- NO public call-outs (needs authority)
- NO influencer outreach (needs social proof)
- NO Twitter campaigns (needs audience)

## Current Strategy (PIVOT - DEC 19, 2024)

### The New Approach: Forum-Based Value Delivery

**Core Principle:** Go where customers are. Be valuable first. Sell later.

**Target:** Mid-size struggling DAOs (NOT the big names)
- Snapshot spaces with <10k members
- Declining participation rates
- New DAOs (launched in last 6 months)
- Active forum discussions

**Channels:**
1. DAO-specific Discourse forums (Optimism, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Gitcoin, etc.)
2. Commonwealth.im (one account, multiple DAOs)
3. NOT Snapshot (it's voting platform, not discussion forum)

**Tactics:**
1. Generate free reports for 5-10 target DAOs
2. Post analysis in THEIR forums (no pitch, just value)
3. Respond to governance discussions with data insights
4. Post 3x/week for 6 weeks minimum
5. Build credibility before asking for anything

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Post in 3 forums, establish presence
- Week 3-4: People start noticing
- Week 5-6: First real conversations
- Week 7-8: First customer (maybe)

## Action Items (IN PROGRESS)

### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. **Research target DAOs** - Need list of 5-10 mid-size struggling DAOs
   - Status: PENDING - Coordinating with research agent
   - Current list (seed-campaign-targets.md) is for BIG DAOs only

2. **Create forum accounts** - After DAO list finalized
   - Create accounts on specific DAO Discourse forums
   - Create Commonwealth account

3. **Generate reports** - For target DAOs
   - Use existing ChainSights tool
   - Focus on actionable insights

4. **Post first analysis** - In 3 target forums
   - Title: "[DAO Name] Governance Health Analysis - Free Report"
   - No pitch, just value

## Key Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Pivot from Twitter to Forums (Dec 19, 2024)
**Reason:** Zero social media presence makes Twitter ineffective
**Impact:** Focus on direct value delivery in DAO communities

### Decision 2: Target Mid-Size DAOs (Dec 19, 2024)
**Reason:** Big DAOs (Optimism, Arbitrum, ENS) require credibility we don't have
**Impact:** Need new target list for accessible DAOs

### Decision 3: Free Reports First (Dec 19, 2024)
**Reason:** Can't sell without proof of value at zero credibility
**Impact:** Generate 5-10 free reports to build case studies

---

## Things NOT To Forget

1. **Mario is starting from absolute zero** - no network, no audience
2. **Seed campaign targets didn't respond** - don't follow up, move on
3. **Twitter thread is dead** - don't waste time on it
4. **Focus on first customer, not scaling** - one success story unlocks everything
5. **Be patient** - this will take 6-8 weeks minimum
