## HOW TELEGRAM WORKS (DIFFERENT FROM DISCORD):

Telegram groups usually have ONE main chat room.
No separate channels like Discord.
Everyone posts in the same place.

---

## AFTER JOINING:

1. WAIT - Don't post immediately

2. READ - Scroll up and read recent messages to understand:
   - What people talk about
   - Community tone
   - If governance discussions happen there

3. CHECK - Look for:
   - Pinned messages at top
   - Group rules
   - Admin messages

4. INTRODUCE - Short message first:
   "Hi, I analyzed Equilibria's governance on Snapshot. Would the community be interested in seeing the data?"

5. WAIT FOR RESPONSE - Let someone reply before posting full analysis

6. IF YES - Share your key findings in a few short messages (not one huge wall of text)

---

## TELEGRAM TIPS:

- Shorter messages work better than long posts
- People reply fast (more casual than forums)
- Can send multiple messages in a row (not rude like forums)
- Use line breaks to make text readable

---

## BUT HONESTLY:

If Telegram feels too complicated right now, SKIP IT.

Focus on Aura and Rocket Pool forums where you already have posts written and ready.

Get your first 2 forum posts live this week.
Equilibria can wait.

---

## PRIORITY:

1. Post to Aura forum TODAY or TOMORROW
2. Post to Rocket Pool forum THIS WEEK
3. Equilibria later (optional)

You need EXECUTION not more research.
