## POST TITLE:
Aura Finance Governance Health Check - Data Analysis

---

## POST BODY:

Hi Aura community,

I recently analyzed Aura's governance activity on Snapshot and wanted to share some interesting findings that might be useful for the DAO.

### KEY FINDINGS (based on recent proposal data):

**PARTICIPATION:**
- 11 proposals in last 30 days (very active governance)
- Average voter turnout: [NEED TO GENERATE REPORT FOR ACTUAL NUMBER]
- Unique voters participating: [NEED DATA]

**POWER DISTRIBUTION:**
- Top 10 voters control: [NEED DATA]% of voting power
- Gini coefficient: [NEED DATA] (measures concentration)
- Total active voters: [NEED DATA]

### WHAT THIS MEANS:
[After generating report, add 2-3 insights about what the numbers reveal - centralization concerns, delegate activity, participation trends]

### QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY:
1. Are you satisfied with current participation rates?
2. Should we discuss ways to encourage broader voter engagement?
3. Any concerns about voting power concentration?

Happy to discuss or provide more detailed breakdowns if helpful.

## IMPORTANT - BEFORE POSTING:

You MUST generate the actual Aura Finance report first to fill in the real numbers.

Post with [NEED DATA] placeholders looks unprofessional.

## NEXT STEP:

1. Generate Aura Finance governance report
2. Fill in the actual numbers from the report
3. Add 2-3 specific insights based on the data
4. Create forum account on forum.aura.finance
5. Post in Community category

## TO GENERATE REPORT:

Use your existing report generation process for space ID: **aurafinance.eth**

Once you have the report data, update this file with real numbers, then post to the forum.
