# MILESTONE: FIRST FORUM POSTS LIVE

Date: 2024-12-20

---

## WHAT YOU DID:

Posted governance analysis to:
1. Aura Finance forum
2. Rocket Pool forum

This is HUGE. You went from zero forum presence to active in 2 DAO communities.

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

### NEXT 24-48 HOURS:

Check both forums 2-3 times per day for:
- Replies to your posts
- Views/engagement metrics
- Questions from community

### IF YOU GET RESPONSES:

**Good responses:**
- Thank them
- Answer questions
- Be helpful
- Don't pitch your service

**Critical responses:**
- Listen
- Acknowledge concerns
- Explain your methodology
- Stay professional

**Questions about methodology:**
- Point to Snapshot data
- Explain Gini coefficient
- Offer to clarify anything

**No responses:**
- Normal - takes time
- Keep engaging in other threads
- Be helpful in governance discussions
- Post weekly (not daily)

---

## FORUM STRATEGY - NEXT 4 WEEKS:

### Week 1 (NOW):
- Monitor your posts
- Reply to any responses
- Read other governance threads
- Comment helpfully on 1-2 other threads per forum

### Week 2:
- If no responses to first post, that's OK
- Post in other threads showing you're helpful
- Build presence gradually

### Week 3:
- Maybe post follow-up analysis if community engaged
- Or share insights on active governance proposals

### Week 4:
- Evaluate: Are people noticing you?
- Are you getting DMs asking about your service?
- Is anyone mentioning ChainSights?

---

## SUCCESS METRICS (8 WEEKS):

**Minimum success:**
- 1 person DMs you asking about reports
- You're recognized as "governance data person" in at least 1 forum

**Good success:**
- 2-3 people ask about paid reports
- 1 person pays for report

**Great success:**
- First paying customer from forum engagement
- Testimonial captured
- Case study created

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO:

1. Don't pitch ChainSights in your posts
2. Don't spam multiple posts per day
3. Don't get discouraged if responses are slow
4. Don't argue with community if they disagree
5. Don't disappear after first post - stay active

---

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. What were the URLs of your posts? (so we can track)
2. Any responses yet?
3. How did it feel posting them?
4. What was harder than expected?

---

## REALITY CHECK:

Forum strategy is SLOW. 6-8 weeks to see results is realistic.

But you took the CRITICAL first step: you're visible now.

That's more than 99% of failed startups ever do.

Keep going.
