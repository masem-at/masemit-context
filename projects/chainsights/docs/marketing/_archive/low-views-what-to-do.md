# Low Views on First Posts - What To Do

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Aura: 0 views
- Rocket Pool: 5 views

---

## IS THIS NORMAL?

YES - for the first few hours/days.

Forum posts don't get instant visibility like Twitter.

---

## WHY LOW VIEWS:

1. Posts are brand new (just posted today)
2. Forums have lower traffic than Twitter
3. Your account is new (no reputation yet)
4. Title might not grab attention
5. Wrong time of day (people asleep)

---

## WHAT TO DO NOW:

### TODAY (Day 1):

DO NOTHING. Wait 24 hours.

Forum posts need time to surface.

### TOMORROW (Day 2):

Check views again:
- Aura: If still 0 views = problem
- Rocket Pool: If under 20 views = slow but OK

### IF STILL LOW VIEWS AFTER 48 HOURS:

**Option 1: Engage in other threads FIRST**

Before expecting people to read your post, you need reputation.

Go to both forums and:
1. Find active governance discussions
2. Leave helpful 2-3 sentence comments
3. Do this on 3-4 threads per forum
4. THEN check if your post gets views

People are more likely to check your post if they see you're active and helpful elsewhere.

**Option 2: Share link in their Discord/Telegram**

Once you have 20+ forum posts/comments (showing you're real community member):
- Join Aura Discord/Telegram
- Join Rocket Pool Discord
- Share: "Posted some governance analysis on the forum, curious what people think: [link]"
- But ONLY after you've been helpful elsewhere

**Option 3: Adjust your approach**

If after 1 week still no engagement:
- Title might be too formal ("Governance Health Check" = boring)
- Try more provocative title next time: "Are 9 people controlling Aura governance?"
- Or question format: "Is Rocket Pool's Nakamoto coefficient of 10 a problem?"

---

## REALISTIC TIMELINE:

### Week 1:
Low views normal. Focus on being helpful in other threads.

### Week 2:
Start seeing 20-50 views if you're active in community.

### Week 3-4:
If you've been consistently helpful, people start recognizing you.

### Week 5-6:
First DM asking about your service (MAYBE).

## THE HARSH TRUTH:

Forum strategy is SLOW.

0 views after 1 day is not a failure.
0 views after 1 week = need to adjust approach.

You need to:
1. Be patient (this takes weeks)
2. Be active (comment on other threads)
3. Be helpful (don't just promote your stuff)
4. Be consistent (3x/week for 6 weeks)

---

## WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:

1. Close the forums for today
2. Check again tomorrow
3. If still low views, start commenting on other threads
4. Build reputation BEFORE expecting attention

---

## ALTERNATIVE FASTER APPROACH:

If forums feel too slow:

**Twitter engagement:**
- Reply to governance discussions from DAO members
- Share insights without pitching
- Build visibility faster (but requires existing audience)

**Direct outreach:**
- DM active forum members
- "Hey, saw you're active in Aura governance, I did some analysis you might find interesting: [link]"
- But ONLY to people genuinely interested in governance data

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION:

Give it 1 week.

Post 2-3 helpful comments on other governance threads in each forum.

Check views again next Friday.

If still under 50 views combined, we adjust strategy.

But don't give up after 1 day.
