## WHAT TO DO AFTER JOINING:

1. Look for these channels in the channel list (left side):
   - #governance
   - #general
   - #discussion
   - #community

2. Read a few messages first to understand the tone

3. Post a short intro message first:
   "Hi everyone, I analyzed Equilibria's Snapshot governance data and found some interesting patterns. Would the community be interested in seeing the findings?"

4. Wait for responses before posting full analysis

5. If they say yes, share your key findings

## IMPORTANT:

Discord is different from forums:
- More casual, chat-style
- Shorter messages work better
- People respond in real-time
- Be ready to discuss, not just post and leave
