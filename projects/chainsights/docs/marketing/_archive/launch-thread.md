## Thread (7 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I kept asking DAOs a simple question:

"Who actually controls voting power here?"

The answer was always the same: "We don't really know."

So I built something to find out.

Introducing @ChainSights_one

#DAO #Web3 #Governance
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
The problem with DAO governance data:

- Wallet addresses tell you nothing about WHO is voting
- Power concentration is hidden across multiple wallets
- "Decentralized" is used without measurement

Most DAOs have no idea who actually controls them.

#DAOs #DeFi #Crypto
```

### Tweet 3 (Insight)
```
Here's what the data often shows:

A handful of wallets holding more voting power than thousands of others combined.

"Decentralized" protocols where 5 addresses decide everything.

The numbers don't lie. Even when the marketing does.

### Tweet 4 (Solution)
```
So we built ChainSights.

One report. One score. The truth about your DAO.

- Who actually controls voting power
- Whale vs delegate breakdown
- Participation patterns
- Decentralization score (1-10)

No speculation. Just on-chain facts.
```

### Tweet 5 (Why It Matters)
```
Why does this matter?

Because "decentralized" shouldn't be marketing copy.

It should be measurable.

And the DAOs that measure it? They're the ones that can actually improve it.
