# Equilibria Finance - Alternative Approach

## DISCORD LINK NOT WORKING

The Discord invite may be expired or have restrictions.

---

## ALTERNATIVE: USE TELEGRAM INSTEAD

Equilibria Finance Telegram:
https://t.me/+PYCzlXH93sU3YWFl

Telegram is easier to join and often more active for DeFi projects.

## OR: SKIP EQUILIBRIA FOR NOW

You already have 2 solid targets with forum posts ready:
1. Aura Finance - forum.aura.finance
2. Rocket Pool - dao.rocketpool.net

RECOMMENDATION:
Focus on posting to Aura and Rocket Pool first.
Skip Equilibria until you can access their community.

---

## PRIORITY ACTION:

1. Create accounts on Aura forum and Rocket Pool forum
2. Post your analyses there
3. Engage with responses
4. Try Equilibria Telegram later if you want

Two active forum engagements is better than waiting for Discord access.

---

## NEXT STEPS:

1. Go to forum.aura.finance - create account
2. Go to dao.rocketpool.net - create account
3. Post your drafts (already written and ready)
4. Start building credibility NOW

Don't let Discord technical issues block your progress.
