# Response to User Challenge - DRAFT

## THE USER'S CHALLENGE:

They said your 53.1% figure is wrong because current on-chain delegation shows Patches at only 1,763/73,297 (2.4%).

## YOUR METHODOLOGY (from your report):

"Analysis based on 10 recent proposals with 146 unique voters. Power distribution calculated using maximum voting power observed per wallet across all analyzed proposals."

"All addresses and voting power figures are sourced directly from Snapshot governance data."

## WHAT THIS MEANS:

You measured HISTORICAL voting power used in Snapshot proposals.
They're looking at CURRENT on-chain RPL delegation.

These are DIFFERENT things - both are valid but measure different aspects.

## RECOMMENDED RESPONSE:

Good catch - I should clarify the methodology.

My analysis is based on Snapshot voting data from recent proposals, not current on-chain RPL delegation. The 53.1% figure represents the top 10 wallets by voting power EXERCISED in recent Snapshot votes (10 proposals, 146 unique voters).

You're right that current on-chain delegation shows different numbers. That's because my analysis measures "who controlled outcomes in recent votes" not "who has delegated power available today."

These are both valuable but different metrics:
- Snapshot historical data: Shows actual influence on past decisions
- Current on-chain delegation: Shows potential influence on future votes

The discrepancy actually highlights an interesting point - not everyone who has delegated power participates in Snapshot votes. The gap between available power and exercised power is itself worth analyzing.

Thanks for pointing this out - I'll make the distinction clearer in future analysis. Both metrics matter for understanding governance health.
