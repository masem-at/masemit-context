## Tweet 1 (Hook)

```
We analyzed 9 major DAOs.

The most "decentralized" scored 3/10.

Here's the ugly truth about DAO governance 🧵

#DAO #Web3 #DeFi #Governance

## Tweet 2 (Rankings)

```
The Rankings:

🥇 Lido — 3/10 (Top 5 = 52%)
🥈 ENS — 3/10 (Top 5 = 31%)
🥉 Arbitrum — 2/10 (Top 5 = 34%)
Optimism — 2/10
Uniswap — 2/10
Gitcoin — 2/10
Balancer — 2/10

#Lido #ENS #Arbitrum #Optimism #Uniswap
```

## Tweet 3 (Shock stat — Balancer)

```
The worst offender?

Balancer: 5 wallets control 97% of all votes.

That's not a DAO. That's a group chat with extra steps.

#Balancer #DAOgovernance
```

## Tweet 4 (Second shock — Gitcoin)

```
Gitcoin — the "public goods" DAO — has 73% of voting power in 5 wallets.

When 5 people decide what's a "public good," is it still public?

#Gitcoin #PublicGoods
```

## Tweet 5 (CTA)

```
I built @ChainSights to expose this.
