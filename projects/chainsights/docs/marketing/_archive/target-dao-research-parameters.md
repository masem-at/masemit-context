# Target DAO Research Parameters

**Created:** 2024-12-19
**Purpose:** Find 5-10 mid-size accessible DAOs for forum-based marketing strategy
**Method:** Manual curation via Snapshot.org browsing

---

## Target Profile: The Goldilocks Zone

**Not too big** (they'll ignore you)
**Not too small** (they're inactive)
**JUST RIGHT** (accessible + active + need help)

---

## PRIMARY CRITERIA (MUST HAVE)

### 1. Size: Mid-Tier
- **Followers/Members:** 1,000 - 10,000 range
- **Why:** Small enough to be accessible, big enough to have forum discussions

### 2. Activity: Recently Active
- **Recent Proposals:** 5+ proposals in last 30 days
- **Why:** Need active governance discussion, but not overwhelming volume

### 3. Platform: Uses Snapshot
- **Voting System:** Snapshot-based governance
- **Why:** Your tool analyzes Snapshot data

### 4. Forum: Has Discussion Space
- **Must Have:** Active Discourse, Commonwealth, or Discord governance channel
- **Why:** Need place to post analysis and engage

---

## SECONDARY CRITERIA (NICE TO HAVE)

### 5. Participation Trend: Struggling
Look for signs of governance challenges:
- **Declining voter turnout** over last 3-6 months
- **Low participation rate** (<15% of members voting)
- **Plateau in engagement** (flat or dropping)
- **Why:** They'll appreciate insights more

### 6. Community: Accessible & Friendly
Avoid:
- Highly defensive communities
- "Cult-like" vibe
- Hostile to outsiders

Look for:
- Open governance discussions
- Welcoming tone in forums
- Active but not toxic

### 7. Potential: Case Study Opportunity
**Ideal candidates:**
- New DAOs (launched in last 6 months) - still figuring things out
- Mid-size DeFi protocols with governance issues
- Layer 2 / infrastructure DAOs (non-top 5)
- Public goods / grants DAOs with participation problems

---

## WHERE TO RESEARCH

### Primary Source: Snapshot.org
1. Go to https://snapshot.org/#/explore
2. Use filters:
   - Sort by: "Activity" or "Members"
   - Browse pages 2-5 (skip the giants on page 1)
3. Click into spaces, check:
   - Member count (aim for 1k-10k)
   - Recent proposals (need 5+ in last month)
   - Voter turnout on recent proposals

### Check Forum Presence
For each candidate DAO, Google:
- "[DAO name] governance forum"
- "[DAO name] discourse"
- "[DAO name] commonwealth"

Confirm they have active discussion space.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

For each DAO you find, document:

```
DAO Name: [Name]
Snapshot Space: [space-id]
Members/Followers: [count]
Recent Activity: [X proposals in last 30 days]
Forum: [URL to Discourse/Commonwealth/Discord]
Why Target: [Brief note on why they're accessible/struggling]
```

**Goal:** Find 5-10 candidates

---

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD TARGETS

**What we're looking for:**

- **Small L2 DAOs** (not Optimism/Arbitrum, think Metis, Scroll, Blast governance)
- **Mid-tier DeFi** (not Uniswap/Aave, think Balancer, Bancor, Frax)
- **Infrastructure protocols** (RPC providers, oracles with governance)
- **Public goods DAOs** (Gitcoin Grants rounds, RetroPGF participants)
- **New DAO experiments** (Launched 2024, still building governance)

**Red flags (avoid):**
- Mega DAOs (>50k members)
- Inactive spaces (<3 proposals in last 2 months)
- No forum/Discord presence
- Token-gated exclusive communities
- High-drama governance conflicts

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER RESEARCH

Once you have 5-10 candidates:

1. **Mary validates** - Checks if they fit criteria
2. **Generate reports** - Run analysis for each target DAO
3. **Forum strategy** - Create accounts, post analysis
4. **Engage authentically** - Be helpful in discussions for 2-4 weeks

*Remember: We're looking for DAOs that will APPRECIATE free governance insights, not DAOs that will ignore us. Quality over prestige.*
