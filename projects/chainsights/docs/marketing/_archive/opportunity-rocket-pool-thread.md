## WHAT YOU COULD COMMENT:

Something like:

"Interesting proposal. From a governance perspective, I recently analyzed RP's voting patterns and found that top 10 wallets control 53.1% of voting power with a Nakamoto coefficient of 10.

If this proposal is contentious as mentioned, it would be valuable to see:
1. How participation rates change for controversial vs routine proposals
2. Whether the voting bloc patterns shift when node operator interests are at stake

Based on recent data, RP averages 70-86 votes per proposal. For a decision this significant, would be interesting to see if participation increases.

Happy to share more detailed governance metrics if useful for the discussion."
