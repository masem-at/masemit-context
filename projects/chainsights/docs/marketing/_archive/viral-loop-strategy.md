# ChainSights Viral Loop Strategy

**Created:** December 17, 2025
**Author:** Maya Rivera (Marketing Strategist)
**Status:** Ready for execution

---

## Executive Summary

ChainSights' viral growth strategy is built on **authenticity over polish**. We start with Share & Save (already built), seed with free reports to influencers, optimize based on data, then layer referral codes if warranted.

**Core insight:** Governance leads are a tight network. One honest tweet from a respected delegate is worth more than 100 paid impressions.

## Phase 2: Seed with Free Reports (Week 1-4)

| Boardroom team | Same space, potential partners | X/LinkedIn |
| Snapshot contributors | Core infra you depend on | GitHub/X |

#### Tier 3: Active Delegates

## Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Cold DM (Short)

```
Hey [Name],

I built something you might find interesting — ChainSights analyzes
who actually controls DAO governance (whale concentration, delegate
power, voting patterns).

I'd love to give you a free report for [DAO they're active in].
No strings attached.

Worth a look?
```

### Template 2: Email (Detailed)

```
Subject: Free governance report for [DAO Name]?

Hey [Name],

I've been following your work on [specific thing they did] —
really valuable stuff for the governance community.

I built ChainSights, a tool that generates "Governance Truth Reports"
showing who actually controls a DAO:

- Decentralization score (1-10)
- Power concentration (top 5/10/20 wallets)
- Whale vs delegate breakdown
- Voting pattern analysis
- Actionable recommendations

I'd love to give you a free Deep Dive report for [DAO they care about].
No strings attached — if you find it useful, share it. If not, tell me
why and I'll make it better.

Interested?

Mario
ChainSights
chainsights.one
```

### Template 3: Follow-Up (If No Response)

```
Hey [Name],

Following up on my note about the free governance report.

Happy to generate one for any DAO you're curious about —
[DAO 1], [DAO 2], or something else entirely.

Either way, no pressure. Just think you'd find it interesting.

Mario
```

### Template 4: After They Accept

```
Awesome! I'll generate the report and send it over within 24h.

Quick question — any specific aspect of [DAO] governance you're
most curious about? (e.g., whale concentration, delegate activity,
specific proposal outcomes)

This helps me make sure the analysis hits what matters to you.
```

### Template 5: Sending the Report

```
Hey [Name],

Your Governance Truth Report for [DAO] is attached.

Highlights:
- Decentralization Score: [X]/10
- Top 5 wallets control [X]% of voting power
- [One surprising insight]

Curious what you think — especially if anything doesn't match
your on-the-ground experience.

And if you find it valuable, feel free to share. If not, I'd
genuinely love the feedback.

Mario

P.S. No need to mention ChainSights if you share — the insights
are the point, not the plug.

## Phase 3: Optimize Share & Save (Week 4-8)

### Data Collection

Track every share in a spreadsheet:

| Date | Customer | DAO | Tweet Link | Followers | Likes | RTs | Sentiment | Led to Referral? |
|------|----------|-----|------------|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|------------------|
| | | | | | | | | |

### Analysis Questions

After 20-30 shares, ask:

1. **What's the share rate?**
   - <15% = Problem (product or offer)
   - 15-25% = Good (optimize)
   - >25% = Great (scale)

2. **What content performs?**
   - Which tweets get engagement?
   - What angles resonate?
   - Copy winning patterns into "share ideas"

3. **Does the reminder work?**
   - Compare shares with/without 24h email
   - If no lift, consider different timing or copy

4. **What follower count correlates?**
   - Do big accounts or small accounts drive referrals?
   - Informs tiered rewards decision

### Potential Optimizations

| If You See | Consider |
|------------|----------|
| Low share rate (<15%) | Improve report value, simplify claim process |
| Shares but no engagement | Better share prompts, stronger hooks |
| Engagement but no referrals | Add tracking links, ask "how did you hear?" |
| High sentiment variance | Product feedback goldmine — act on it |

---

## Phase 4: Referral Codes (Month 2+ — Only If Warranted)

### The Mechanism

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Customer A  │     │ Customer B  │     │ Customer A  │
│ Gets Code   │ ──► │ Uses Code   │ ──► │ Gets Credit │
│ (ELENA20)   │     │ (€10 off)   │     │ (€20)       │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### When to Build

Only invest dev time if:
- Share rate >20%
- At least 5 organic referrals tracked
- You have bandwidth

### Implementation Notes (For Later)

| Component | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Code generation | Low | Random alphanumeric or custom |
| Code validation at checkout | Medium | Stripe coupon or custom logic |
| Credit tracking | Medium | New table, admin UI |
| Payout mechanism | Medium | Credit vs cash vs next purchase |

## Key Principles

### 1. Authenticity Over Polish

> In Web3, real voices beat corporate messaging. A heartfelt tweet from a 500-follower delegate converts better than a polished post from a 50K influencer.

### 2. Value First, Ask Second

> Give free reports without asking for anything. If the product is good, shares happen naturally. If not, you learn why.

### 3. Honor Criticism

> "We'll honor the cashback even if your tweet includes criticism." This isn't just policy — it's brand. It says: "We're confident enough to pay for honesty."

### 4. Compound, Don't Blast

> One tweet won't change everything. But Month 1 notice → Month 3 remember → Month 4 buy. Consistent presence in the right circles compounds.

### 5. Start Manual, Automate Later

> Track in spreadsheets. Verify tweets manually. Send DMs yourself. Automation comes after you understand what works.
