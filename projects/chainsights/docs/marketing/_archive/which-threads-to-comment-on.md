# Which Threads Should You Comment On?

## TWO THREADS YOU'RE LOOKING AT:

### Thread 1: Minipool Delegates (Dec 19)
- 2 replies
- About: Mandatory protocol upgrades
- Governance relevant: YES (voting, participation, contentious decision)

### Thread 2: Institutional Custodians (earlier)
- 14 replies
- About: Revenue sharing with custodians
- Governance relevant: SOMEWHAT (but more about business/economics)

## WHICH ONE TO COMMENT ON?

**THREAD 1 (Minipools) = BETTER FIT**

Why:
- Your governance data is directly relevant
- Discussion about voting on contentious proposals
- Your insights about participation rates add value
- Only 2 comments = easier to stand out

**THREAD 2 (Custodians) = SKIP FOR NOW**

Why:
- Already 14 replies (harder to add unique value)
- More about economics than governance
- Your data doesn't fit naturally
- Would feel forced

## GENERAL RULE: WHEN TO COMMENT

**COMMENT when:**
- Thread is about governance decisions/voting
- Your data adds value to the specific discussion
- You have genuine insights (not just promoting yourself)
- Thread is early (under 10 replies = easier to get noticed)

**DON'T COMMENT when:**
- Thread is about tech/economics/unrelated topics
- Your data doesn't naturally fit
- You'd be forcing your governance analysis into everything
- Thread already has 15+ replies (hard to stand out)

## RECOMMENDATION:

Comment on the MINIPOOLS thread with the suggested text.

Skip the custodians thread for now.

Wait for more governance-specific discussions to appear.

---

## LOOKING FOR THREADS ABOUT:

- Voting mechanisms
- Proposal processes
- Participation/quorum requirements
- Decentralization concerns
- Power distribution debates
- Controversial governance decisions

THESE are where your data is most valuable.

## QUALITY > QUANTITY

Better to comment thoughtfully on 1 perfect thread than force your way into 10 unrelated discussions.

Post the minipools comment today.

Then wait for the next governance-relevant thread.
