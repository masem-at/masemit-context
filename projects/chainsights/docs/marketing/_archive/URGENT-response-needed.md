# URGENT: User Challenged Your Data

## THE CHALLENGE:

User says your Nakamoto coefficient calculation is wrong.

Their data:
- Largest delegate (Patches): 1,763 voting power out of 73,297 total
- Says top 10 can only reach ~15%, not 53%

Your data said:
- Top 10 control 53.1% of voting power
- Nakamoto coefficient: 10

---

## WHAT WENT WRONG:

You analyzed SNAPSHOT voting data (who voted on past proposals).

User is looking at CURRENT on-chain RPL delegation data (who has power NOW).

THESE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS.

---

## THE ISSUE:

Your analysis shows:
- Who actually USED voting power in recent votes
- Based on Snapshot historical proposal data

User is looking at:
- Who currently HAS voting power available
- Based on current RPL staking/delegation

Many people who have power don't vote = different numbers.

---

## HOW TO RESPOND:

**Option 1: Clarify your methodology (HONEST)**

"Good catch - I should have been clearer. My analysis is based on actual voting activity on Snapshot proposals, not current on-chain RPL delegation.

The 53.1% figure represents the top 10 wallets by voting power USED in recent Snapshot votes, not total available voting power. You're right that current on-chain delegation shows different numbers.

This means my analysis answers: 'Who controlled outcomes in recent votes?' not 'Who has power available today?'

Both metrics are useful but measure different things. Thanks for the clarification - I'll make this distinction clearer in future analysis."

**Option 2: Admit you might be wrong (IF YOU ARE)**

"You might be right - let me double-check my methodology. I analyzed Snapshot voting data, but if current on-chain delegation shows different numbers, I may have made an error in my analysis.

Can you point me to where you're seeing the 1,763/73,297 figures? I want to make sure I'm comparing apples to apples."

## WHICH RESPONSE TO USE:

**If your report used Snapshot historical voting data:** Use Option 1

**If you're not sure what your analysis measured:** Use Option 2

---

## THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT:

How you respond determines your credibility.

**GOOD response:**
- Admit if methodology was unclear
- Clarify what you actually measured
- Thank them for pointing it out
- Show you're open to feedback

**BAD response:**
- Defend your numbers without checking
- Argue with community member
- Delete your comment
- Ignore the challenge

---

## WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:

1. Check your Rocket Pool report - what data source did you use?
2. Did you analyze Snapshot voting history or on-chain delegation?
3. Draft a response based on Option 1 or Option 2
4. Post it within 24 hours (don't wait too long)

## LEARNING:

This is why forum strategy is valuable - you get REAL feedback on your methodology.

This user just helped you improve your reports.

Respond professionally and you'll gain respect even though you got challenged.
