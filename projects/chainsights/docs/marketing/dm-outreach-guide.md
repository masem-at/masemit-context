# DM Outreach Strategy for ChainSights

**Purpose:** How to reach out to DAO delegates and governance participants via direct message when forum approach isn't viable (dead forums, low activity).

**Status:** Use sparingly - Forum strategy is primary approach

---

## When to Use DM Outreach

✅ **Use DM When:**
- Forum is dead/inactive (<10 posts/week)
- DAO has no active forum, only Snapshot voting
- Targeting specific high-value delegate

❌ **Don't Use DM When:**
- Forum is active (post there instead!)
- You haven't engaged with their content first
- You're not sure they're actually active in that DAO

---

## The Right DM Flow (3-Step Process)

### Step 1: First DM - Tease Value, Ask Permission

**NEVER send full report in first DM.** That's too aggressive and looks spammy.

**Template:**

```
Hey [Name],

Noticed you're active in [DAO name] governance. I analyze DAO voting patterns
and ran [DAO name]'s data—found some interesting [specific finding teaser].

Would you want to see the breakdown? No strings, just thought you'd find it
interesting given your involvement.
```

**Key Elements:**
- ✅ SHORT (2-3 sentences max)
- ✅ Shows you know who they are
- ✅ Teases 1 specific finding (creates curiosity)
- ✅ Asks permission (not pushy)
- ✅ "No strings" = establishes non-salesy intent

**Example (AladdinDAO):**

```
Hey [Name],

Noticed you're a top delegate in AladdinDAO. I analyze DAO voting patterns
and found some interesting concentration in your top 10 holders (72% of voting power).

Would you want to see the full breakdown? No strings, just thought you'd
find it interesting given your delegate role.
```

### Step 2: If They Respond "Yes" - Send Report with Context

**Template:**

```
Great! Here's the full report: [attach PDF]

Key things that stood out:
• [Finding 1 - specific data point with number]
• [Finding 2 - specific data point with number]
• [Finding 3 - actionable insight or trend]

Curious what you think—especially about [specific question related to their
governance work].
```

**Why This Works:**
- Provides context before they open PDF
- Highlights most interesting/actionable parts
- Asks for their opinion (starts conversation, not pitch)
- Shows genuine interest in their governance work

**Example (AladdinDAO):**

```
Great! Here's the full report: [attach chainsights-report-aladdindao.pdf]

Key things that stood out:
• Top 10 holders control 72% of voting power (high concentration)
• Participation dropped 40% over last 6 months
• 3 addresses vote identically 95% of the time (potential coordination)

Curious what you think—especially whether this concentration is intentional
(multisigs, team) or something the DAO is concerned about.
```

---

### Step 3: If No Response - Single Follow-Up (3-4 Days Later)

**Template:**

```
Following up—totally fine if this isn't interesting to you!

Just thought the data on [specific finding] might be relevant given
[recent proposal or governance event].

Either way, happy to share if useful 👍
```

**Then STOP.** Max 2 touches. If no response, move on.

**Example (AladdinDAO):**

```
Following up—totally fine if this isn't interesting!

Just thought the voting power concentration data might be relevant given
the recent treasury allocation proposals.

Either way, happy to share if useful 👍
```

## Who to Target (Finding the Right People)

### ✅ Good Targets:

1. **Top Delegates** (High voting power, active participation)
   - Find: Snapshot space → Delegates tab → Sort by voting power
   - Must have: Recent activity (voted in last 30 days)

2. **Core Team Members** (Engaged in DAO operations)
   - Find: Twitter, Discord, DAO documentation
   - Look for: Official roles, regular governance posts

3. **Active Commenters** (People who comment on proposals)
   - Find: Snapshot proposal discussions, forum threads
   - Shows: They care about governance details

### ❌ Bad Targets:

- Random community members (not governance-focused)
- Inactive accounts (haven't voted in 3+ months)
- Multiple people from same DAO at once (looks spammy)
- People you've never engaged with on social media

## Pre-DM Checklist

Before sending ANY cold DM:

- [ ] Confirmed they're active in this DAO's governance (voted recently)
- [ ] Found 1-2 specific findings they'd care about
- [ ] Have Twitter/social profile to verify they're real/active
- [ ] Engaged with 1-2 of their recent posts (like/retweet)
- [ ] NOT sending to multiple people from same DAO simultaneously
- [ ] Have the report ready to send if they say yes

**If all boxes checked → Send DM**

**If any box unchecked → Wait or reconsider**

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Response rate | 20-30% (realistic for cold DMs) |
| Reports delivered | 50%+ of responders |
| Conversations started | 20%+ of deliveries |
| Leads/interest | 5-10% of conversations |

**Reality check:** Most won't respond. That's normal. Focus on quality targets.

---

## When to Choose Forum vs. DM

| Scenario | Approach | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Active forum (10+ posts/week) | **Forum post** | Better ROI, builds public credibility |
| Dead forum (<5 posts/week) | **DM to delegates** | No one will see forum post |
| No forum, only Snapshot | **DM to delegates** | Only direct channel available |
| Both active forum + Snapshot | **Forum first**, DM later if needed | Public visibility > private outreach |

**Default Rule:** Forum first, DM only when necessary.

---

## Red Flags (Don't Send)

🚫 **Stop if you're thinking:**
- "I'll blast 20 delegates at once" (looks spammy)
- "I'll send the report immediately" (too aggressive)
- "They have a dead Twitter, but..." (won't respond)
- "I haven't checked if they're active recently" (waste of time)
- "I should follow up 3-4 times" (harassment)

## Example: AladdinDAO Outreach Plan

**Target:** 2-3 top delegates from aladdindao.eth

**Step 1: Research** (10 minutes)
1. Visit [snapshot.org/#/aladdindao.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/aladdindao.eth)
2. Click "Delegates" → Sort by voting power
3. Identify top 3 delegates with:
   - Recent voting activity (last 30 days)
   - Twitter profile linked
   - Actual governance participation (not just holding tokens)

**Step 2: Warm Up** (1-2 days)
1. Follow them on Twitter
2. Like/retweet 1-2 governance-related posts
3. Don't mention ChainSights yet

**Step 3: Send First DM** (Day 3)
Use template from Step 1 above

**Step 4: Wait** (3-4 days)
- If response → Send report with context
- If no response → Single follow-up, then move on
