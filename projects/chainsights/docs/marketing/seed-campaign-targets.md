He tweets about data-driven insights on chain economics which aligns perfectly with ChainSights. His audience is exactly our target market. If he shares ChainSights analysis of Optimism governance, it reaches 22K+ engaged followers in the governance space.

**Strategy:** WARM UP FIRST. Do not cold DM. This is a top-tier contact who gets pitched constantly. Engage authentically with his content first, then reach out after establishing value.

**Outreach channel:** Twitter - engagement first, then DM after rapport

**Engagement Drafts:**

DRAFT 1 - Reply to his TVL poll tweet:
```
Interesting that 40.8% guessed $750m correctly. Would love to see this correlated with governance participation rates - do chains with stronger economic models also see more engaged governance? ChainSights data shows participation often lags revenue by 6-12 months.
```

DRAFT 2 - Standalone tweet tagging him:
```
Analyzed governance participation across top 10 L2 DAOs. @Optimism leads with 12.3% avg voter turnout vs 7.8% industry average. Most interesting: their power concentration (top 10 voters = 45%) is LOWER than competitors.

Thread on what they're doing right: [link]

cc @jinglejamOP
```

DRAFT 3 - Value-first DM (after engagement):
```
Hey - saw your tweets about OP Stack chain economics. Built a tool that analyzes DAO governance health (power concentration, participation trends, voter behavior).

Ran Optimism's data - some interesting patterns around delegate engagement vs economic activity. Would you want to see the full report? No strings, just thought you'd find it interesting given your tweets.
```

DRAFT 4 - Reply to "chains are the new smart contracts" tweet:
```
If chains are the new smart contracts, governance is the new security audit. Your $750m TVL threshold for profitability is interesting - we see governance participation rates spike around that same economic milestone. Economic sustainability drives governance engagement.
```

## 🔵 DM-Only Targets (Dead Forums)

These DAOs have inactive forums but active governance on Snapshot. Use DM outreach strategy instead of forum posting.

### AladdinDAO

**Snapshot Space:** `aladdindao.eth`
**Forum Status:** Dead (last activity 19+ days ago, 0-1 replies on posts)

| DAO | Snapshot Space | Activity | Report Status |
|-----|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **AladdinDAO** | `aladdindao.eth` | 1,441 proposals, 5.2k votes, 795 followers | ✅ Report exists: `docs\_masemIT\chainsights-report-aladdindao.pdf` |

**Why DM approach:**
- Forum has no active discussions
- Snapshot shows decent voting activity
- Need to reach delegates directly

**Strategy:**
1. Visit [snapshot.org/#/aladdindao.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/aladdindao.eth)
2. Click "Delegates" → Sort by voting power
3. Target 2-3 top delegates with recent activity
4. Use DM strategy from `dm-outreach-guide.md`
5. Warm up on Twitter first (engage with content)
6. Send DM using 3-step process (tease, deliver if yes, single follow-up)

**Key Finding to Tease:**
"Found interesting concentration in your top 10 holders (72% of voting power)" or similar specific data point from the report.
