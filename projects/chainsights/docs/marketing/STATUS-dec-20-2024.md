## CURRENT STATUS:

### Forum Posts:
- Aura: Posted (0 views so far - very new)
- Rocket Pool: Posted (5 views so far - very new)

### Active Engagement:
- Rocket Pool minipools thread: Comment posted
- **NEW (Dec 20):** Received organic response - community member using our analysis to form governance opinion on RPIP-47 and megapool/minipool features
- **Status:** Real discussion happening, positioned as helpful analyst (not vendor)

### Time Invested:
Today only - forum strategy just started

### Success Already:
✅ Sparked real governance discussion (faster than expected timeline)

---

## WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT:

### Next 24 Hours:
- Check if views increase on your main posts
- Check if anyone responds to your minipools comment
- Don't expect instant results

### Next Week:
- Look for 1-2 more governance threads to comment on
- Be helpful, don't force your data into every thread
- Build presence gradually

### Next 2-4 Weeks:
- Should see some engagement (replies, views increasing)
- People start recognizing you as active member
- Maybe first DM asking about your service

---

## SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK:

Weekly check (every Friday):
- Total views on main posts (target: 50+ each by end of week 1)
- Replies received (target: 1-2 by end of week 2)
- Other threads commented on (target: 2-3 per week)

---

## WHAT TO DO TOMORROW:

1. Check forums once in morning
2. Check forums once in evening
3. If you see new governance-related threads, read them
4. Only comment if your insights add value
5. Don't post new analysis yet (let first posts settle)

---

## REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

Forum strategy is SLOW but SUSTAINABLE.

Week 1: Low engagement (normal)
Week 2-3: Starting to see responses
Week 4-6: People know who you are
Week 8: First customer inquiry (MAYBE)

You're doing it right. Be patient.

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:

1. CONSISTENCY: Check forums 2x/day for next 6 weeks
2. HELPFULNESS: Comment where you add value (not everywhere)
3. PATIENCE: Don't expect results in days, expect weeks
4. AUTHENTICITY: Actually care about governance, don't just sell

---

## YOU'RE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE:

Most people never post at all.
You posted 3 things on Day 1.
That's more than 99% of startups do.

**UPDATE (Dec 20 - Same Day):**
Already getting organic discussion responses. Expected timeline was Week 2-3, but quality content sparked conversation immediately. This validates the forum strategy.

**Current approach: Don't over-engage.** Let discussion breathe. Only respond when your data adds real value to debate.

Now just stay consistent.
