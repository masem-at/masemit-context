## POST TITLE:
Aura Governance Health Check - Some Concerning Data

---

## POST BODY:

Hi Aura community,

I ran some analysis on Aura's recent governance activity on Snapshot and found some numbers that I think the community should be aware of.

### THE DATA (based on 10 recent proposals):

**PARTICIPATION:**
- Only 9 unique voters participated across all recent proposals
- Most proposals get just 4-7 votes
- Same 4 core participants form a consistent voting bloc (11.18M voting power)

**POWER CONCENTRATION:**
- Top 5 wallets control 81.5% of total voting power
- Top 1 wallet alone: 20.7%
- Nakamoto coefficient: 3 (only 3 entities needed for >50% control)

**DELEGATE vs WHALE ACTIVITY:**
- Delegates are active: 5 out of 6 maintaining 18.75-20.83% participation
- Whales are largely absent: only 4.17% and 2.08% participation from top holders
- Delegates hold 61.8% of total voting power (16.6M vlAURA)

### WHAT THIS MEANS:

The good news: Delegates are engaged and governance keeps moving.

The concerning part: With only 9 people voting and just 4 forming a consistent bloc, we're essentially a small group chat making decisions for the entire protocol. That's risky.

### QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY:

1. **Is this a problem?** Maybe 9 active participants is fine if they're trusted delegates?

2. **Should we try to increase participation?** Or is low turnout just the reality of DAO governance?

3. **What about inactive whales?** Large holders aren't participating - should we encourage them to delegate or vote?

I'm not trying to alarm anyone - just sharing data I thought might be useful for discussion. Would love to hear what the community thinks about these numbers.

Are you comfortable with the current participation levels, or should we explore ways to increase engagement?

**Note:** This analysis is based on Snapshot data from recent proposals. Happy to share more detailed breakdowns if useful.
