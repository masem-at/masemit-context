# Deeper Discovery

Now let's explore a few more angles to sharpen the positioning:

## Problem Space:

1. Why does masemIT need a website NOW? Beyond "tellingCube references it" - what happens if someone lands there and it's empty or doesn't exist? What impression does that leave?

**Answer:**  
As a visitor, this would seem somewhat implausible or unprofessional to me.

2. What's the ONE thing a visitor should remember after leaving masem.at? (Even if you offer multiple products)  

**Answer:**  
A committed, professional, and credible company with a clear vision.

## Competitive Landscape:

3. Who are your "competitors" in the visitor's mind? Not product competitors, but other small AI/SaaS companies they might compare you to. What do their websites look like? Too flashy? Too boring? Too enterprise-y?

**Answer:**  
I cannot answer this question, maybe we coould do a market research?

## Differentiation:

4. What makes masemIT different from the hundreds of other "AI company" sites? Is it:
  - Your technical depth (you actually build, not just consult)?
  - Your focus on SMEs/startups (not chasing enterprise contracts)?
  - The interconnected product ecosystem (tellingCube → tellingDash)?
  - Something else?

**Answer:**  
- yes of course
- that's also true. Giving small businesses the opportunity to benefit from AI.
- maybe, but not in focus, as mentioned it's more used for the implementation phase and incidentally, both can be used independently of each other in production
- not for the moment

5. Minimum Viable Site: If you had to launch in 3 days with just ONE page, what absolutely MUST be on it?        

- masemITs vision
- masemITs products, for now only tellingcube, i don't know if is good to present the other projects/products
- newsletter
- contact form (i know your question was about one page)
- legal sites (i know your question was about one page)
- faq
- fancy hero pic or video
- social links
- trust section (i have 2-4 sites, that would show trust, but they are more related to fundnest: see trust sources)
- a11y
- i18n en/de
