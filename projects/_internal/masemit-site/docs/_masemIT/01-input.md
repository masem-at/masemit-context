# masemIT Website Motivation

# General
The site is intended to be the central presence of masemIT e.U.
We (I = sole proprietorship at the moment) develop AI-supported SaaS platforms, more on that later.
We are also available for AI-related projects (consulting, development), but that is not our main focus, and when we do take on such projects, we are selective about what we do.

To better assess the target audience, I am listing the current projects here, sorted by priority or implementation plan:

## Projects / Producs

### tellingCube.com (Status: pre-launch MVP, will happen on 12/17/2025)
tellingCube is a SaaS tool that generates realistic, mathematically consistent business data for testing, demos, and training. Using AI-powered event sourcing, it creates thousands of interconnected business events (sales, payroll, procurement) that perfectly reconcile across finance and sales views—eliminating the “fake data problem” where synthetic datasets contain impossible patterns. Available as CSV downloads and JSON API, it's built for BI developers, consultants, and trainers who need production-quality demo data in minutes instead of days.

### chainsights (Status: Idea exists, no development yet)
ChainSights is an API-first, no-code analytics platform that turns raw on-chain data into actionable insights for Web3 companies.
It helps DAOs, DApps, and NFT projects understand wallet behavior, user funnels, and governance activity through intuitive dashboards and developer-friendly APIs.

### MMS - masemIT microservices (Status: to be redesigned)
MMS should be the central service layer in the future for all masemIT projects/products (tellingCube, ChainSights, tellingDash, fundnest, etc.). For example, there should be a central party (companies, persons) storage across the entire project/product landscape. All backend APIs for these assets should be implemented in this layer in the future. MMS should/could also be the access layer for APIs we provide to customers.

### tellingDash.com (Status: Vision)
tellingDash is a dynamic dashboard generation tool that creates professional, IBCS-inspired business visualizations on the fly from your real data. It uses tellingCube's synthetic datasets for development and testing, but in production connects to actual customer data sources to generate publication-ready charts, variance analyses, and executive reports instantly—no manual design work required. Think “describe what you need, get a CFO-ready dashboard.”

### fundnest.at (Status: launched but currently no further development > will become a brownfield case)
fundnest.at is a funding discovery platform for SMEs, sole traders, startups, non-profits, and organizations. It continuously collects and structures funding programs and helps users quickly identify relevant grants and subsidies for their specific projects.

**... and many more in my mind.**

The outcome of the visitors should be: yes, they know how they can shape the future based on AI, not only for enterprises, but also for small companies and startups.
