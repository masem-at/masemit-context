# Product Brief: masemit-site

**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Author:** Mario

---

## Executive Summary

masem.at is the central web presence for masemIT e.U., an Austrian sole proprietorship developing AI-powered SaaS platforms that make enterprise-grade data intelligence accessible to small and medium-sized businesses.

The website serves three purposes: (1) establish professional credibility for the company, (2) showcase the product portfolio starting with tellingCube, and (3) provide a unified entry point for visitors discovering masemIT through product references.

The site must launch alongside tellingCube (December 17, 2025) to ensure brand consistency and professional presentation when users encounter "masemIT" branding on product sites.

**Core message:** We ship AI products that work. AI tools for businesses that don't have enterprise budgets.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

When potential customers, partners, or curious visitors encounter "masemIT" through product references (e.g., on tellingCube.com), they currently find no central company presence. This absence creates an impression of implausibility and undermines the professional credibility essential for B2B trust.

### Problem Impact

- **Lost trust:** Visitors questioning if masemIT is a legitimate company
- **Missed opportunities:** No clear path to discover other products or services
- **Brand fragmentation:** Products exist in isolation without company context
- **Credibility gap:** Technical excellence hidden behind missing web presence

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Currently, there is no masemIT website. The company's credibility relies entirely on individual product sites, which don't communicate the broader vision or company backing behind them.

### Proposed Solution

A professional, corporate website (masem.at) that:
- Presents masemIT's vision and commitment to AI-powered solutions for SMEs
- Showcases tellingCube as the flagship product (with room to add others later)
- Functions as the "About Us" for the product ecosystem (simple, clean, answers "Who made this?")
- Provides essential trust signals and contact pathways
- Supports bilingual visitors (German/English)
- Prioritizes accessibility and clean, professional design

### Key Differentiators

1. **Builders, not consultants:** masemIT develops and ships real products—tellingCube launches Dec 17, 2025
2. **SME focus:** AI tools designed for small businesses and startups, not enterprise-only pricing and complexity
3. **Technical depth:** Founded by someone who codes, not just strategizes
4. **Austrian roots:** Local credibility with international product ambitions

### Party Mode Insights (Incorporated)

| Agent   | Feedback Applied |
|---------|------------------|
| John (PM) | Lead with action ("we ship"), not claims. Shipping IS the credibility signal. |
| Winston (Architect) | Treat site as "About Us for ecosystem." Keep MVP minimal—ship what doesn't embarrass. |
| Sally (UX) | User-centric headline: "AI tools for businesses without enterprise budgets." Make visitors feel seen. |

## Target Users

### Primary Visitors

**"The tellingCube Curious"**

**Profile:** A business trainer, professor, consultant, or BI developer who just discovered tellingCube and is evaluating whether to use it for their demo data needs. They noticed "© 2025 masemIT e.U." in the footer or saw "a masemIT product" in documentation and clicked through to masem.at.

**Context:**
- Working on BI projects, training materials, or client demos that need realistic test data
- Frustrated with synthetic data that doesn't reconcile (Finance doesn't match Sales)
- Time-pressured—needs a solution that works, not a science project
- Understands terms like "mathematical consistency", "AC/PY/PL/FC", "IBCS-inspired"

**What Brought Them Here:**
- Clicked "masemIT e.U." link from tellingCube.com footer
- Googled "masemIT" after seeing the branding
- Checking vendor credibility before signing up or recommending to their team

**What They Need From masem.at:**
- Quick confirmation: "This is a real company" (< 30 seconds)
- Professional appearance that matches tellingCube's quality (same colors, same feel)
- A face/story behind the product (who built this?)
- Easy path back to tellingCube or to contact for questions

**Success Moment:**
They think: "Okay, this is legit. Austrian company, real person behind it, clear vision. I'll try tellingCube."

---

### Secondary Visitors

| Visitor Type | Arrival Path | Primary Need |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **IBCS Community Member** | IBCS channels, CEO (Jürgen Faisst) referral, conferences | Realistic demo data for visualizations; trust via personal connection |
| **Consulting Lead** | Google, LinkedIn, industry referral | Proof of AI expertise, contact path |
| **Future Product User** | Discovers tellingDash or other products later | Understand the masemIT ecosystem and roadmap |
| **Partner/Investor** | Industry networking | Company background, vision, traction |

**Note on IBCS:** masemIT is not IBCS-certified (future possibility). Language should use "inspired by IBCS®" to respect the standard without claiming official certification. The trust signal for IBCS visitors is the personal relationship with the CEO, not a certification badge.

*Secondary visitor needs will be refined based on actual traffic data post-launch.*

---

### Visitor Journey (Primary)

```
tellingCube.com → sees "masemIT e.U." in footer → clicks → masem.at
     ↓
Landing: "AI tools for businesses without enterprise budgets"
     ↓
Quick scan: Vision, Products (tellingCube highlighted), About
     ↓
Credibility confirmed (< 60 seconds)
     ↓
Returns to tellingCube → Signs up / Recommends to team
```

### Party Mode Insights (Incorporated)

| Agent | Feedback Applied |
|-------|------------------|
| John (PM) | IBCS is a strategic channel, not just "secondary." Two primary visitor types. tellingCube site already defines the user: "trainers, professors, consultants." |
| Sally (UX) | Design for coldest visitor (satisfies both). Same design language as tellingCube—same house, different room. |
| Winston (Architect) | IBCS is a marketing channel, not site architecture. Use resonant language ("mathematical consistency", "publication-ready") without special sections. Inherit tellingCube's design system. |

---

- Visitor lands from tellingCube → scans site → thinks "legit company" → returns to product
- Target: < 60 seconds to credibility confirmation
